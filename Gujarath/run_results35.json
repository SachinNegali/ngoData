   "detailsOfAchievement": "The intervention of SSSS in SANGATH project..We encouraged registered cooperatives society members to understand the formalities of avail credits from main stream financial institutions such as nationalized bank in their operational areas. A competent resource person was hired to conduct the sessions. During the training program we also touched upon topic likes various government schemes, market functional strategies etc. Altogether more than 800 cooperatives members took part in the training program.One of the planned results was to initiate small scale business by the registered cooperative societies. All 4 of them have initiated the same. The cooperative at of Vadgam has opened shops at Vadgam and Palanpur city where they are selling cloths as well as handicraft articles. Cooperative members at Meghraj are involved in selling handicraft item like doormats vegetables, washing powders, and at Nanakatharia, cooperative members are also involved in selling ladies garments and washing powders. And at Asal, cooperative members are involved in selling garments like saaries, they purchase plain saaries and make them beautiful by patch work.We were also able to access financial assistance from Rural Technology Institute- Government of Gujarat for skill development training program for the cooperative members. Altogether 150 cooperative members from four partner locations received training program on livelihood skill training program, the participants received Rs. 2,25,000/- as stipend and received Machines worth Rs. 1,75000/- for Paper plate and cup making. we have also impart other livelihood skills training to approximately 907 cooperative members on different livelihood skill such as tailoring, beauty parlor, handicraft and kitchen gardening. As a result of the training program many of the participants have started their own business such as tailoring 38 women, kitchen garden 180 women, beauty parlor 20 women, handicraft 56 women and 10 of them are involved in cookery. The intervention of SSSS in Safe Motherhood Healthy Childhood project has made us realize remarkable progressive growth of change in the mindset of the poeple who are under our care and the results achieved. However, these results could be interpreted in terms of the status of implementation of the planned activities; the quality of progression, process and mechanisms adopted; VHWs commending enthusiasm; staff capacity and measures adopted in the project for ensuring RCH indicators & access to the government services on health and the active participation of these communities in the project. The achievements gained are far more heartening than initial stages of the project. We are happy to articulate that through this project, we could interact with different groups of people though some of which are of cyclical in nature such as pregnant mothers, lactating mothers, mother-in-laws, youth and village Health Committee in every village of the project area. Our working presence has educated them on various kinds of health issues that invoke their realization of participation for progression of their very own self and village development.",

On the one hand, with an increase in urbanization most of the societies are in transition and the young population is under less social restraint. On the other hand, lower literacy level of rural women, especially in the state and local customs & traditions make women more vulnerable to the infection. Large numbers of women suffer from reproductive tract infections (RTIs), which are mainly due to poor sexual hygiene especially during menstruation and sexually transmitted infections from their spouses."

   "detailsOfAchievement": "SARTHI is working in two hundred ninety four villages in all the four district of Gujarat on the issues at Micro, Macro levels. The approach of SARTHI has been to mobilize the tribal communities and make them aware about their rights and entitlements by forming and strengthening their Community Based Organization such as women Self Help Groups and Village Development Committees. The local resource persons were identified for providing issue-based awareness to the CBOs were identified and the leaders were trained on related issues like NREGA, Food entitlements, right of women to own land and property, Holistic health, and women empowerment, Panchayati raj other government entitlements. Self Help Groups SARTHI is working with four hundred seventeen SHGs in two hundred villages in four districts (including Dungarpur district of Rajasthan), and the total number of members is five thousand seven hundred sixty three. Womenâ€™s Health More then two hundred women has been trained as a Dais (Traditional Birth Attainders) and 120 women have been trained as a barefoot gynecological who provides the herbal treatment. Program on Hiv/Aid: SARTHI have been organized awareness camps on HIV/Aids in the its working area of the Santrampur, Lunawada, Halol and Kalol taluka of Panchmahals district and at present SARTHI is working with the Gujarat State Aid Control Society, Ahmedabad for the TI project for five thousand single male migrant. Gender Sensitization (Adult men) SARTHI tries to sensitize the men on the situation of the women under a range of programs. It is unmistakably important to sensitize the adult male villagers on gender equality topics. SARTHI has created a program for adults, with about five thousand adults included. Discussion has been held through meetings and workshops on sex education, gender, family planning, contraceptives, HIV/AIDS and sexual diseases, body knowledge etc, which helps to improve the womenâ€™s reproductive health as well as general health. Still they are sharing and having discussion on above topics with other adults. About fifty percent of the men stated that they could understand the situation for women in society and they have started to help the women for reducing their workload. Program for Adolescents Government policies and programs have largely ignored adolescents in HIV prevention. Knowledge among adolescents regarding safer sex and condoms is inadequate and inconsistent. Every year SARTHI has given sex education and gender sensitization to the local youth. About ten thousand youth has so far participated the program, both school going and non-school going.

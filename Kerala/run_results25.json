   "detailsOfAchievement": "We have been successful in organising varied cultural activities for the promotion of traditional and classical art forms of Kerala all these years. Intresetingly, this includes resucitating many an art form on the verge of extinction. Parisha Vadyam, the percussion ensemble which is the precursor of Panchavadyam could be reproduced successfully. In this connection, a group of young percussionists were tyrained specifically for this by the only surviving maestro Thrikamburam Krishnankutty Marar. A week-long workshop was held for this. Revival of Thiruvathirakkali, group dance by village women was another major achievement. Training classes for young artistes in music, dance and percussion is a regular programme. Arangettam (debut performance) of many of them could be held on many occasions. We are proud that at least a good number of them have graduated into professional artistes in this areas. Music and dance festivals are regularly held to provide performance ooportunities to them. Such festivals also showcase exponents which serves as a very good exposure to the up-and-coming artistes. Documentation of the rare art forms peculiar to this area is another major achievements. All of them have been preserved in CDs.",

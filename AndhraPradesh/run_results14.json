   "detailsOfAchievement": "Brief Narrative about the Organisation Sahayog Community Coordination Network (CCN) is a registered Not- for-Profit Society consisting of a group of experienced professionals and educated tribal youths intensely working with the vulnerable indigenous groups to support them to gain control over their lives and resources in two Mandals of Paderu Region, Visakhapatnam district of Andhra Pradesh. The Organisation was promoted by the eminent Civil Servant (Late Mr. S.R. Sankaran IAS) who has been the guide and support for this Organisation since its origin along with other likeminded civil servants interested in Tribal empowerment. The objective of the Organisation was to attract young professionals from reputed academic Institutes to engage themselves in tribal development and bridge the gap between Government policies and their execution in the community. The Young professionals were given intensive mentorship under the Head of Premier Organisation on Tribal development- Girijan Cooperative Co operation and ITDA to work with community at cluster level. The Organisation was evolved after 3 years of work by the professionals to support and sustain the work carried out. Sahayog CCN is working in Munchingput and Peddabayalu Mandals of Paderu division, Andhra Pradesh. The major livelihood issues in this region has been depleted natural resources of land and water, poor health and nutritional status, poor educational and infrastructure facilities and very low level of household income which is around Rs.10, 000 to Rs.15, 000 /per annum which is much lower in terms of the standards elsewhere in the country. Organisations Vision : Self reliant tribal community who has full ownership and control over their resources and capable to take decisions on their lives. Mission : The Mission is to build self sustained organization of vulnerable tribal communities to improve their standard of living through sustainable use of natural resources with their full ownership, participation and Trust. Our Core Values. ïƒ¼ Trust. ïƒ¼ Transparency. ïƒ¼ Farmers Interest First. ïƒ¼ Participation by all. Sahayog CCN works towards a self reliant Tribal community and its role has been defined as: 1. Facilitator of empowerment processes in the community. 2. Capacity building and skill development of the Community. 3. Network and collaboration with external and internal stakeholders and mobilisation of resources for the Community. Sahayog CCN adopts a 3 pronged strategy for its community empowerment process. 1. Source Young Professionals from relevant academic backgrounds from premier institutes in India and train them on key aspects of community development and empowerment. 2. Young Professionals deployed at cluster level in turn identify educated local tribal youth and provide the training on development issues and build a Team named Community Coordination Team (CCTs) to carry on with the activities and become entrepreneurs for the community. 3. Build paraprofessional at cluster level and establish linkages with partners and collaborators and source resources. The critical strategy is to promote and strengthen Tribal community institutions Federated at multiple layers with full participation by Tribal women in the area. Leveraging on existing community resources is specifically employed to ensure sustainability of the institutions and community initiatives even after the project exit. CCN has worked with number of Partners- Government Agencies, National and International funding partners. Research institutions etc. and have over 2 decades of experience in working with the tribal communities.",

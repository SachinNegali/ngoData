It aims to spread awareness in the society through exchange of ideas, and through raising debates relevant to our times. We endeavour to do socially relevant theatre and conduct workshops, seminars, debates and audio-visual shows as part of our effort to be involved in the ongoing social and intellectual churning. The group participated in JNU Theatre Festival (RANG BAYAAR), 4th IPTA Natya Rangotsav, Jaipur, Jashn-e-Zabaan (A Celebration of Language and Expressions), in Jaya Utsav (Celebrating Living Traditions of Mahabharata) and in the 21st and 23rd Urdu Drama Festival. It has also been invited to perform at Jamia Millia Islamia, India International Centre, and India Habitat Centre. We debuted as a cultural group with our performance of Jaisi Karni Waisi Bharni at the 21st Urdu Drama Festival on 17th February 2010, at Shri Ram Centre. Chand Roz Aur Meri Jaan in Urdu (directed by Salima Raza), Waseem in Hindi (directed by Sharmistha Saha), Gandhi Park in Hindi (directed by Tarique Hameed), Bheemaparvam in Malayalam (directed by Samkutty Pattomkary), Ant Nahin in Hindi (directed by Samkutty Pattomkary), White Nights/Rajat Ratein in Bengali/Hindi (directed by Soumyabrata Choudhury) and Jaisi Karni Waisi Bharni in Urdu (directed by Firoz Z Khan) are the successful productions of the group. Apart from theatre performances, we have also conducted â€˜Baisakhiâ€™, a cultural evening of dance and music like Odissi, Bharatanatyam, Kuchipudi, Manipuri, Kathak, Hindustaani Vocal and Rabindra Sangeet, an exhibition of paintings, â€˜Discussion and Exhibition of Patachitraâ€™ (a folk painting from West Bengal), â€˜Theyyamâ€™ (A folk performance from Kerala), â€˜The Lovesong of J. Alfred Prufrockâ€™ ( A dramatic presentation of T.S. Eliotâ€™s poem), and a lecture and discussion on Matriarchy by Prof. Hoshang Merchant from HCU.",

WCF also takes up important research in identifying tourist places and help in planning to become sustainable in their respective operations. It wishes to come out with international Handbook presenting the new know-how methodologies and best practice of the different dimensions of the Culture Guide Services. Since ancient and medieval times, there had been many conflicts and assimilations of different cultures. This is primarily because of differences/discrimination in Race, color, religion, faith, caste, creed, region, etc. Humanity and the world had to take the blunt of these differences. In order to reduce and mitigate these, WCF is actively involved in promotion of world peace and cultural- harmony through its activities of inter-cultural interactions and to promote unity in diversity.",

        "detailsOfAchievement": "Foundation for Research in Endangered Species in the Himalaya was established in the year 2004. The Himalayan region stretches in the North from Kashmir to the eastern end of Arunachal Pradesh. This region is immensely rich in natural resources and represents a wide variety of rich flora and fauna. The region inherently has unique indigenous characteristics and is home to some of the rarest species of both flora and fauna. The places in the Himalayan region like Uttarakhand have features that remain confined to those particular states only. At present the efforts of FRESH have been confined to the Central Himalayan region in the state of Uttarakhand but in future we do intend to cut across to other borders. Some background study is being conducted by FRESH in the state of Sikkim on the rare orchids in association with the people from Sikkim University. It is not only about the rare species of flora and fauna that FRESH has been concerned about but it is also about the indigenous people that we have shown great amount of respect for. The local people in the Himalayan region have great similarities in their clothing, housing, eating habits rituals and other facets of culture and yet they have a unique distinct identity. It is strange that despite the fact that they have such common geographical surroundings and still they have their own identity. FRESH has conducted alots of research regarding the lifestyle issues of such people like the Bhotias, Shaukas and some other indigenous people in the region of Uttarakhand. The daily living of the residents of the hilly regions is entwined with their earnings. FRESH realises that in the fragile ecosystems of the mountains it is preposterous to set up hotels and other huge infrastructure ventures. A lot of our endeavour has been to empower through workshops and seminars the local people in ecotourism. Home stays have been encouraged and the local residents have been also trained in housekeeping and kitchen craft. We at FRESH realise that it is not only the flora and fauna of the Himalayan region that is endangered today but it is also the culture of the region that needs to be preserved and protected. It is equally endangered. A lot of the initiative has been to undertake projects where we have gone on location and conducted video and audio recordings of some of the finest folk forms of Uttarakhand. Empowering women, the most crucial link in the life of the mountains, has been one of the significant initiatives of FRESH along with the youth of the region. A lot of the effort at FRESH is on a perfect blend of the traditional with scientific approach. Employment generation and restoring dignity for the local residents has been another endeavour of FRESH.FRESH imparts training in food processing, horticulture, ecotourism etc to the local youth.",

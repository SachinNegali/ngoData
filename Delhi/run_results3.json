Shiksha Muhim has three segments 1. ECCE- Early Childhood Care Education and Environment ( 3 to 5years) 2. Primary Education, Health and Environment Programme (6 to14years) 3. Education, Vocational training, Health and Environment programme for Adult Women (15 years and above) Major Achievements 10530 out of school girls have cleared 5th standard examination, conducted by the District Primary Education Office and obtained certificate. 16235 girls got admission in the formal schools after getting education and motivation from AGS NFE centres. 125 adult girl and women have also cleared primary education under its literacy and education programme for adult girls and women. More than 8750 students have completed pre primary from AGS ECCE centre and have taken admission in formal schools for primary education More than 11275 girls and women have obtained training in tailoring and jewellery designing and making from AGS vocational training centres. ï€ Education level of girls was very low in the region but AGS intervention in the field of education through its NFE centers has increased literacy rate and the parents are also showing interest in sending their daughters to Non-formal and formal schools. Real achievement of AGS is to bring positive and constructive attitudinal change among people, male and female, towards girls education in the region. Change from NO to girl education to demand for it. Girls have developed self-confidence and sense of self-esteem and self worth, that was lacking very much among them. Community participation in the formation and implementation of the AGS programme through Village Level Education Committee that consist of men and women of the community. Collaboration with State Government for effective and efficient functioning of AGS programme. AGS has organised several health camps related to Reproductive and child health, HIV and AIDS, Personal Health and Hygiene, Childhood related disease like polio, diarrhea, Anemia and other health related issues for its beneficiaries and other community members. AGS child plants a sapling on her birthday and take care of that for long. This makes our students environment friendly and also contribute to the environment.",

In 1989 it was registered as Adishakti Laboratory for Theatre Art Research {ALTAR} Public Charitable Trust in Delhi. This so that it could function on an all India basis belonging to no specific region but able to root itself freely anywhere in the country. Both a theatre troupe and a locus for hybrid performing arts and interdisciplinary research Adishakti is the home from which national and international performances, workshops, artist exchanges and research are generated. Adishaktis goal is to develop a contemporary new aesthetic in postcolonial times by drawing upon seminal Indian knowledge systems and processes of knowing. Adishaktis work consequently is known to have influenced Indian arts practice in the fields of music, traditional forms, folk arts, dance and cinema.",

   "detailsOfAchievement": "Introduction: India International Rural Cultural Centre (IRCEN) has been serving the nation with a sole concept of promoting and performing arts that conceives values which contributes to promotion of humanity and peceful existence of mankind. Established in the year 1979 under the founder Presidentship of the then Honourable Chief Justice of India,Shri Y.V.Chandrachud, with a view to formulate and carry out such programmes which may help raise the standard of arts and social values in rural and tribal areas of the coutry. The Organisation has grown in strength year by year expanding its activities far and wide under the guidance of its Managing Committee comprising eminent persons from public administrations, management and other spheres of public life. By virtue of its nationwide activities and a number of branches in different States, it has attained status of an ALL INDIA LEVEL ORGANISATION. It has been proud privilege of the Organisation to have been headed continously for 17 years by the serving Chief Justice of India from 1979 to 1996 when Dr.Abid Hussain, a seasoned administrator and Indias Ambassador to U.S.A., took over the office of President of the Organisation having been unanimously elected by the Members of IRCEN. In 2002, the General Body, elected unanimously Shri S.C.Mahalik,former Secretary to Govt. of India and former Chairman, Orissa State Electricity Regulatory Commission, as President of India International Rural Cultural Centre. After he successfully completed 2 terms of office of 3 years each, Shri Lalit Mansingh, former Foreign Secretary,Govt.of India and Indias Ambassador to U.S.A. took over as President of the Organisation. The programmes and activities of the Organisation are implemented under the following heads:- Youth Programmes i) Cultural Outreach to Rural & Tribal Youth The Rural youth in India are at disadvantageous position as they find themselves away from urbanised facilities. The life normally concentrates in city. Different beliefs, different traditions and customs, different religions are practiced in this country of cultural diversity. Future of India is shaped always by the largest segment of Indian society â€˜the youthâ€™. The young generaton who is equally proud of their countryâ€™s heritage and are learning to experiments to innovate positive ideas to new cultural exploration need to be exposed to cultural diversity and traditions of India. The Organisation has rightly chosen young boys and girls of rural schools and colleges as its target group. Every year hundreds of lecture-performance cum workshops on Indian classical dances and music are organised in rural and tribal schools/colleges all over the country for the purpose of strengthening cultural values in education so that young generation should be acquainted with such values associated with Indian classical dances & music. These programmes of classical music & dances are presented by renowned performing artists. IRCEN has been fulfilling this task under one umbrella scheme â€œNational Programme for Youth and Adolescents Development (NPYAD)â€ of the Ministry of Youth Affairs & Sports, Govt. of India. ii) Income-Generating Training Programmes The youth of India form one third portion of our population and they are integrated as forceful segment of Indian society. A great importance is attached to the development of this largest segment of the nation. Hence more opportunities should be created for them to develop their personality and functional capabilities. We have to inculcate in the minds of youth love for the country and its crying needs. It is, therefore, essential to channelise the energy of youth into constructive force so as to promote a sense of national integration and secularism among them. There are thousands of illiterate, unemployed, underprivileged, and backward classes of people in India. Hence, there is a greater need hard work to achieve freedom from backwardness and to promote human society to a better world of prosperity and culture. In order to achieve this, â€˜India Interntional Rural Cultural Centreâ€™ has been implementing at the grassroots of human society such projects in district towns in cooperation with the district authorities, benefiting the downtrodden and poverty stricken sections of Indian society. For this purpose, capacity building programmes such as income generating training, community living, promotion of social values, anti-drug addiction drive, preservation of Indiaâ€™s cultural heritage, national integration among youth, strengthening of cultural values in education, are regularly launched in the country mainly in the rural and tribal areas for the benefit of youth. IRCEN makes its best efforts to set up Vocational Training Centres in different rural, tribal and suburban areas of the country in order to provide an opportunity to the youth for the purpose of training in light technology, like bamboo-crafting, electronic goods such as T.V., Radio, etc. Repair training and in many more areas. Even, after completion of their training IRCEN helps the trainees to set up their own entrepreneurship and further helps them in securing loans from Government Nodal Agencies. iii) Exposing Youth to Cultural Diversity through Multi-Cultural Activity Several hundred recitals of Indiaâ€™s classical music an dances as well as of folk dances and music of different regions of the country are presented regularly in different rural and tribal schools/colleges all over the country on the pattern of â€œexchange cultureâ€. This programme not only exposes youth to vivid forms of Indiaâ€™s cultural heritage and diversity but also spreads a message of cultural integration among youth of different regions of the country. In this process, special care is taken to expose youth to cultural traditions of different regions so that there could be useful interactions among the youth. The programme is presented by senior performing artists. Millions of rural youth have participated in such programmes and interacted with Artists face to face. Although Indian cultural patterns are diverse yet the luxuriant fabric of unity and vision to look at the different sect of cultural heritage with appreciations always prevail. This scheme encourages the rural young populace to understand the hoary tradition of Indian Arts which imbibe a national consciousness. Eminent Artists such as Ustad Amjad Ali Khan, Ustad Asad Ali Khan, Padambhushan Prof. Debu Chaudhuri, Padamshri Ustad Sabri Khan, Pt. L.K. Pandit, Padamshri Prabha Atre, Smt.

   "detailsOfAchievement": "Indian Blind Sports Association (IBSA) was founded in 1986 as an outcome of the pioneering initiatives taken by the Blind Relief Association, Delhi, to develop and promote sports for blind youngsters. IBSA has since emerged as the premier national blindsports body in the country with 194 Affiliates in 25 States. It is the sole Indian Affiliate of the International Blind Sports Federation, the apex sports organization for blind sports in the world. It is also affiliated to the Paralympic Committee of India. One of this Association athletes, Shri Ramkaran, has been presented the coveted Arjuna Award as an outstanding Para-sportsperson by Honourable Rashtrapatiji in August 2012. The Association coach, Dr. Satyapal Singh, has been conferred the prestigious Dronacharya Award at the same function for being adjudged an outstanding coach. As many as 20 National Sports Meets have been conducted by IBSA in collaboration with the Blind Relief Association. These Meets have now become a regular biennial event which is eagerly awaited by the blind sportspersons all over the country. These Meets comprise athletic events like sprints, throws, jumps etc. conducted in accordance with international rules. Apart from the National Sports Meets which primarily focus on athletics, IBSA also organizes national level tournaments and championships in 5 a side football, powerlifting, kabaddi and judo for the blind. It was IBSA which introduced 5-a side football and powerlifting for the blind in the country and also standardized rules for Kabaddi for the blind. IBSA has so far organized 9 nationals in football, 6 in powerlifting, 3 in kabaddi and 1 in judo. With a view to enhancing the standards of blind sports in the country the Association has conducted a number of coaching camps on a regular basis. In these camps services of reputed coaches and experts are utilized to transmit knowledge and practices of scientific training, sports medicine, health, diet to the participants from across the country and thereby help them upgrade their skills in sports. Thanks to such untiring grass-root level sports development efforts of IBSA the standards of our athletes and sportsmen have gone up significantly and many of them have been winning laurels in International level competitions IBSA has sponsored Indian contingent of blind athletes to participate in all the four World Games and Championships for the Blind, held in 1998, 2003, 2007, 2011 and 2014 at Madrid (Spain), Quebec (Canada), Sao Paulo (Brazil) Antalya (Turkey) and Seoul (Korea) respectively. The Association also sponsored athletes to take part in the 2009 and 2011 IBSA World Youth and Student Championships held at Colorado Springs, USA. Recently a team of 15 blind sports persons was sent to take part in Fifth IBSA World Championships and Games held in Seoul, Korea in May 2015. Similarly 11 footballers were sent to Tokyo, Japan to take part in the IBSA Asian Blind Football Championship.",

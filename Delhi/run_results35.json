   "detailsOfAchievement": "Conducting research has been the most important activity of the Institute. It has completed over 70 study projects, the details of which are available on its website. Most of the research projects undertaken have been sponsored by different ministries of Government of India or international agencies. These generally have dealt with national and state policies oriented issues related to management and development of water resources, rural development and poverty alleviation, environmental preservation, disaster management, gender studies and socio-economic development. A majority of the studies have involved conduct of large scale socio-economic field surveys resulting in collection of primary data. Such surveys have been conducted in almost all parts of India. The studies have also enabled the Institute to gain considerable experience of interaction with government machinery at the central, state, district levels and below. The findings and suggestions of these studies are available in the reports submitted to the respective sponsoring agencies. Conducting training programmes for senior government officers has been another activity of the Institute. Several such programmes including those for senior IAS officers have been conducted. Details provided on the Instituteâ€™s website. These were one or two weeks programmes dealing mostly with optimum utilization of resources veering around economic and environmental analysis of major development projects. Most of the training programmes have been sponsored by the respective ministries of Government of India. The institute has played an active part in organizing international, national as well as state level seminars and conferences on important policy related issues (Details on its website). The most notable among these has been the International Conference on Sustainable Development of Water Resources, in 2000. These have been organized in Delhi as well as in other parts of the country and have generally been sponsored by different ministries of Government of India, State Governments, International and other agencies. These seminars and conferences have been well attended with the right mix of participation from government, academic institutions and NGOs depending upon the context and have come forward with very useful recommendations. Institution building has also been an important activity specially in the earlier years. The Institute established a spacious office complex of its own with all the requisite facilities such as office and staff rooms, computer rooms, library, seminar hall, computers, LCD projector etc. located in a well connected institutional area and surrounded by a host of public institutions. Allotment of land for the same was got approved by Delhi Development Authority while, the Ministry of Finance, Government of India, agreed to our request to provide a major grant for construction of the office complex. The Institute also succeeded in getting 80G sanctioned by the Income Tax Authorities. The Institute established a rich library which can be used by outside scholars, professionals and students also. Since 2002,the Institute has also set up a study centre for BCA students within its office complex sponsored by Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU). This centre is equipped with 30 desktop computers and other facilities.",

   "detailsOfAchievement": "Seminars on Bio fuel & Green Energy for Sustainable Growth and Impact on Climate Change The Institute of Applied System and Rural Development IASRD has taken up awareness program for promotion of bio fuel for sustainable growth to compliment the efforts in ensuring energy security of the Nation. To achieve this objective the Institute has organized 11 seminars in 11 states namely: 1st Seminar was held at Delhi 2nd seminar at Nashik Maharastra 3rd seminar at Anand Gujarat 4th seminar at Lucknow UP 5th seminar at Bangalore Karnataka 6th seminar at Raipur Chhattisgarh 7th seminar at Dhanbad Jharkhand 8th seminar at Haridwar Uttarakhand 9th seminar at Jodhpur Rajasthan 10th seminar at Patna Bihar& 11th seminar at Aizwal Mizoram. The basic objective of the seminar is to promote awareness for increasing the use of Bio fuel & Green Energy to ensure energy security for sustainable. The objective activities like Seminar & awareness programmes were financially supported in the form of Grants in aid by the various Ministries like of Earth Sciences Ministry of New & Renewal Energy MNRE. Ministry of Rural Development & also sponsored by the Govt. Oil Companies like IOC HPCL & BPCL. Institute has also organized Awareness program for School Children on Impact of Climate Change & their Role to mitigate it in Raipur district of Chhattisgharh, Haridwar district in Uttarakhand and Gautam budh Nagar in UP. Fourth program has been conducted last year in Anand district of Gujarat. The primary objective of the programme is to sensitize and encourage the students of 6th to 10th standards in the age group of 10 to 17 for their active participation in mitigation of climate change and to help them to learn, understand and address the impacts of global warming today, at the same time encouraging the change in their attitudes and behavior needed to put up efforts on a more sustainable path in the future. Undoubtedly the climate change is going to effect the next generation adversely. It is therefore necessary to initiate action to arrest the change in deteriorating climate now. The children hence need to be mainstreamed into larger debates on climate change, hazards and vulnerabilities with an overview of the linkages between climate change and sustainable development which is threatened by increasing frequency of hazardous weather and the inability of the poor and most vulnerable to adapt to climate variability and extremes. The awareness programme on Climate Change is linked with the Tree Plantation Programme.",

   "detailsOfAchievement": "The Institute of Social Sciences was registered on 28 August 1985 under the Societies Registration Act, 1860. The Institute commenced its journey with the objective â€œto study contemporary social political and economic issues and problems, in an interdisciplinary perspective and to make available its findings and recommendations to government bodies, social scientists, policy makers, peopleâ€™s and workersâ€™ organizations, so as to widen their options for action. The evolution of an informed and action-oriented public opinion is the primary aim of the Institute.â€The Institute takes considerable pride both in its research and advocacy work. As a Ford Foundation document puts it, the Institute of Social Sciences is â€œa leading centre which has a strong legitimacy among senior policy-makers, bureaucrats and politicians. It regularly hosts high-profile meetings and workshops for policy-makers, training institutions and leading non-governmental organizations.â€ The ISS has created a niche both among policy-makers and civil society through its numerous researches; advocacy through conferences, seminars and workshops; and monitoring through public interest litigations and other more direct forms of interventions. Academicians, political leaders including those holding ministerial ranks or constitutional positions, public servants, and social workers have joined hands and lent their support to the Instituteâ€™s efforts in the field of local self-government. The Institute grew over the years and eventually moved to its new premises. The then Vice-President of India Shri K R Narayanan laid the foundation stone of the building on 7 October 1994 at Nelson Mandela Road, Vasant Kunj. The building having a total built-up area of 13,211 sq.ft was completed in 1998 and the ISS finally shifted to its new premises in May 1999.The generous financial contributions from various State governments, countries, international bodies and individuals amounting to over Rs.2.50 crores speak volumes for the enormous goodwill, professional competence and legitimacy that the ISS acquired in such a short span of its life. The Institute has developed a computerised library and documentation centre in the new building. The centre has established a network with institutions engaged in similar areas of study as well as with local government bodies in the various states. Government and non-government organisations, international agencies, U.N. organisations are seeking the help of the Institute for data on local government system. Research scholars and students from India and abroad visit our library for reference. The role of the ISS attracted groups of scholars and activists in other States which led to the birth of new centres of ISS. The first centre was established in Bangalore in 1994 which was followed by centres in Bhubaneswar (1999), Kolkata (2002) and Thiruvanthapuram (2003). Each Centre was demand-driven from the respective regions. They lobbied for their projects independently of the ISS at Delhi. The Institute is currently at an important phase of its further development. It is also redefining the thrust areas for research and other interventions, in order to provide a definitive meaning and direction to its future course of action.",

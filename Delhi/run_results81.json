   "detailsOfAchievement": "The Society for Conservation of Nature (SCON) is a non-profit, non-governmental organization, registered under the Society Act of Govt. of India. It was founded on July 22, 1998 with a mandate of serving as an intellectual force that provides awareness, research and policy inputs for sustainable development. Since its inception, SCON has organized a wide spectrum of activities including scientific talks, environmental awareness & community services. The SCON also undertakes the following activities from time to time on need basis. â€¢ Awareness programmes for national and international policy makers. â€¢ Regional workshops on issues related to environment and agriculture. â€¢ Field projects on agriculture and environment. Indian Nitrogen Group (ING) Reactive nitrogen dominated the attention of SCON throughout this decade, mainly due to our early realization of its importance. The need to synergies the scientific community around reactive N led SCON to establish the Indian Nitrogen Group (ING) during the INSA workshop of 2006. Through ING, SCON not only brought reactive N to the forefront of discussions in all the relevant ministries of the Indian government, planning commission, academia and industry, but also became the sole Indian representative in many international fora including the International Nitrogen Initiative (INI). The SCON persuaded the INI to establish a separate regional center in South Asia for coordinating its activities among the South Asian countries. When INI decided to set it up in New Delhi, SCON naturally became its partner of choice in the region. Thus, SCON established a South Asian Nitrogen Centre (SANC) in New Delhi in 2008.With the help of UNEP, INI andING-SCON, SANC held a South Asian workshop on Reactive Nitrogen in 2010 to galvanize the South Asian partners for regional N assessment and nutrient management.",

Despite paucity of resources, it has curved out a niche for itself in the realms of participatory action research, social development, grassroots level social services, advocacy and policy- making processes. The most notable achievement of the SDRS lies in developing and getting recognition for Disability Studies (by Ministry of Human Resource Development/ Government of India) as an academic discipline to be taught in universities and colleges throughout the country. Consequently, Disability Studies programmes have been started in several universities/ academic institutions (including IGNOU, BR Ambedkar University, Periyar, Gauhati and Alagappa universities) at the instance of the SDRS. The process is in full swing in certain other universities (including the Universities of Kerala) to launch a series of programmes on Disability Studies. In the sphere of disability advocacy, the SDRS has played a crucial role by taking up with concerned ministries/ departments/ organizations the cases of victimization and discrimination as also denial of basic human rights of the disadvantaged sections of society, including persons with disabilities (who are the aggrieved parties) at various levels, ranging from difficulty in issuance of Disability Certificate, Medical/ Clinical Referral Services, Accessibility and Education to Employment, Social Security, Promotion and Protection of Rights of Persons with Disabilities and Other Vulnerable Groups. Tens of thousands of persons with disabilities have so far been ensured justice at various levels. It is due to our sustained campaign that rights- based perspective of disability could be the cornerstone of 11th Five Year Plan on disability. Similarly, the issues related to disability have been incorporated into the Poll Manifestos of National and State Level Political Parties in certain Statesâ€”including Bihar, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra. Especially in the field of facilitating accessibility and implementation of three per cent reservation in education, employment and social security, it has been working uninterruptedly as an effective pressure group. The finalization of Report of 11th Five Year Plan Working Group on Empowering the Disabled (2007-2012), constituted by Planning Commission, Government of India under the chairmanship of Dr G. N. Karna (Honorary President of SDRS and a noted expert on Disability Studies/Human Rights). The SDRS has also been actively associated with Core Group on Disability, constituted by National Human Rights Commission/ Government of India to monitor the implementation of UN Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities by Central and State Governments. Quite recently, the SDRS has succeeded in getting the scourge of polio wiped out from a village named Mohan Budhiyam (falling under Pandual Block of Madhubani district of Bihar) affected by mass polio; as the NHRC took suo moto action on the petition moved by SDRS and directed the Government of Bihar to take appropriate corrective measures. This is the only organization in India to develop and promote teaching and research in the area of Disability Studies as academic foundation of disability rights movement.",

        "detailsOfAchievement": "Asha with its community based holistic development activities have progressively impacted the lives of slum dwellers since its inception. Today, immeasurable improvements in physical, social and socio economic conditions of slum dwellers are evident from the fact that community members are actively promoting and supporting the programmes. In its 28 years of existence, Asha has developed a comprehensive model of service delivery where Healthcare services are combined with other Social Determinants in order to bring about comprehensive transformation. Currently Asha is working in 71 slums across Delhi covering a population of more than 5 Lakhs. The Healthcare Services provided by Asha is widely recognized by institutions across the world for efficiency, impact and quality. Asha has trained women working in slums who are engaged as Community Health Volunteers. They regularly visit and monitor the health of communities particularly pregnant women, children under five, elderly and T.B. patients. Through committed efforts by Asha, almost 100% deliveries across slums have been institutional or by the help of trained professionals. Infant mortality rates and Maternal Mortality rates have reduced significantly. Asha communities are adequately manned by doctors, nurses and paramedical staff. In addition, mobile health clinics cater to areas which do not have health centres. For advanced Healthcare and Diagnostics, Asha Polyclinic is well equipped with sophisticated laboratory, X-ray, ECG, Ultrasound and other diagnostic facilities. CHVs are provided regular trainings which are time to time supplemented by Refresher trainings. Asha has developed a Comprehensive Education Programme where final year school students are chosen and provided thorough training in Academic, Behavioural and Psychological aspects so that they excel in their chosen fields and are ready to pursue higher education. There are English Literacy and Computer courses to provide these much needed skills to students. Internship programmes for Final year students and Graduates have recorded impressive growths and students across Asha slums have been placed in MNCs as well as top Indian corporates. This has been a huge boost to their careers. Moreover, Mentorship programme undertaken by Asha has been a huge success with a professional Mentor assigned to each student who provide counselling, guidance and advice to add cutting edge to the professional career of students. Empowerment programmes have been the bedrock of Ashas Development Interventions. Bal Mandal and Mahila Mandal are the forums for discussion and solving Community issues relating to Health, Sanitation, Infrastructure, Education, Public Health and also for raising Awareness and Sensitization. These forums have also increased the Collective Bargaining power of slum dwellers. Finally, Financial Inclusion programme across slums have facilitated economic independence and empowerment and have helped many slum dwellers to earn a living and support their familys needs.",

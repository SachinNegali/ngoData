Most important programs run by Supreme Task are leadership development, equipping and training youth of India, Child Development, Health services and awareness, Education to all and disaster mitigation. We are also working in one of the poorest District (Balangir) of Orissa under KBK districts announced by Govt. of India. Out of various needs of the people of Balangir District, Health is an emerging need owing to lack of medical/health facilities compiled with decreasing health status of people. Drought, less industrialization, unemployment, migration, etc. contributes to the poor health status of people in different Blocks. One 150 bedded Hospital in District headquarter and 13 other Primary Health Centers, which are not properly equipped in terms of manpower and equipment found to be inadequate in meeting the health need of 13,35,760 people of this District. Based on the need, we have taken over an existing Eye Hospital and converted it to 50 bedded General Hospital in Balangir district headquarter. We have a plan to equip this hospital with all latest medical equipments, sufficient manpower and better service facility for the people of this area.",

        "detailsOfAchievement": "Based on the fore thought on the burning problems of rural India such as farmersâ€™ suicides, infertility of land, drought related issues, unprecedented migration to cities and subsidiary impact on cities in terms of slum dwelling etc. a conference was organized to find solutions that could impact the farmers and generate sustainable methods to achieve economic and social turnaround. Surabhi Foundation organized a 3-day international conference in New Delhi with participation by people from various facets of society including scientists, leaders, businessmen, farmers, journalists, NGOs, social activists and thinkers. The conference was organized by Surabhi Foundation in collaboration with Indian Council of Agricultural Research (Ministry of Agriculture) on â€œHOLISTIC RURAL DEVELOPMENT THROUGH ORGANIC FARMINGâ€ on September 10 & 11 2009. Wholistic Rural Empowerment Program contributes directly to achieving the objectives of poverty and hunger alleviation through inclusive agricultural growth and improved nutrition. Cow based economy model aims to empower these farmers to become self dependent and earn a â€œrespectable and reliableâ€ self-sustainable livelihood. The first step in â€œCow Based Economyâ€ Model starts with enabling village households to own two cows each. This is possible through Micro-finance institutions that lend loans to villagers at attractive and viable conditions. Eventually, the loan shall be repaid from the cash-flows generated by various products of cow itself. Cow is a source of economic value as well as nutrition through its products. Cow-milk, which is a rich and balanced source of all nutrients, feeds the household, while surplus is sent to a â€œcentralizedâ€ village-exchange for further processing and for selling purposes. Village exchange is a central body run by villagers themselves to organize trade and help households with a ready collection and distribution-centre. Women empowerment by training on converting primary to secondary products were imparted: such as conversion of wheat to flour by hand milling, conversion of whole grains to pulses by using small machines, conversion of milk to ghee and other milk products. Training also focused good practices, quality requirement and cooperative working. We are working on artisan development and on creating self employment opportunities throughout the country. Involvement of educated youth from premier institutions across the nation such as IITs, IIMs, NIFTs etc. is a focus area for our organization. We have organized various programs for the same. Students are given research and development projects on important social causes. Surabhi Foundation ensures environmental sustainability in all its projects. In agriculture, the holistic farming techniques guarantee that the health of the soil is maintained, rather improved in some cases. Promotion of low energy technologies and renewable energy resources is undertaken in the cow based economy model.",

        "detailsOfAchievement": "SEEDS (Sustainable Environment and Ecological Development Society) is a national humanitarian agency that engages with the local communities in enhancing their resilience to environmental threats, such as extreme weather events, natural calamities etc. SEEDS is driven by the organizational vision of â€˜Building Resilient Communitiesâ€™. As a humanitarian organization, SEEDS works closely with the local government authorities and reaches out to communities that have been impacted by disasters. Going beyond relief, SEEDS has helped them adapt to future such events through process of raising awareness, learning, introduction of resilient technologies, weather monitoring etc. Such measures have helped strengthen the communityâ€™s coping capacities. Founded in 1994, SEEDS originated as a college based interest group in School of Planning and Architecture (SPA), Delhi, delving in research on environment and habitat issues. In the initial years, majority of the projects were actually the study undertaken to understand the depleting environment and its impact on communities. The core of this vision still remains. However, over the period of time SEEDS focused on Building Resilience through Disaster Risk Education; wherein acknowledging the depletion of eco systems and environment as the inherent cause for perpetuating disasters. The Gujarat earthquake of 2001 was a major turning point, when SEEDS got fully involved in relief and rehabilitation activities. Support was mobilised from a wide range of donor agencies, NGOs, academic institutions, governments and individuals to create a model rehabilitation project in Patan district, Gujarat. The success of the project, wherein people built their own homes their own ways with their own designs and measured inputs from SEEDS to ensure earthquake resistance, paved the way for sustained disaster management programmes not only in Gujarat, but also to other vulnerable states in the hill and coastal regions of the country. SEEDS has worked in more than 12 emergencies and have been able to achieve highest level of professionalism and quality in all its endeavors. This is attributed to its team of young professionals consisting of planners, architects, engineers, project management specialists and media experts. SEEDS is governed and advised by a board of eminent academicians and practitioners from international organization. SEEDS, primarily engages in shelter reconstruction and adopts locally based approaches to reduce the impact of future disasters on vulnerable communities. Over the years, SEEDS has constructed more than 5000 houses and restored over 50 schools across the country. Today, SEEDS continues to advocate for and work with communities across Asia to build a safer and more sustainable world. SEEDS is a member of National Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction (NPDRR) constituted by Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India. It is the first Indian agency to be certified by â€œHumanitarian Accountability Partnershipsâ€ â€“ which is signatory to the Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent. SEEDS Indiaâ€™s long term Rehabilitation Project after Gujarat Earthquake, focused on participatory rehabilitation and reconstruction in Patanka Village in Patan District of Gujarat was termed by United Nations as an International best Practice in Rehabilitation. The project was also covered as a good practice on community disaster resilience in the world disaster report 2004. In 2010, SEEDS was adjudged as â€˜Indian of the Yearâ€™ in the public Service category by CNN IBN for its efforts in Leh. SEEDS holds key membership in almost all national and internal networks working towards of Disaster risk reduction including International Red Cross and Red Cresent, Asian Disaster Risk Reduction Network, Sphere etc.",

Consequently, TERI has created an environment that is enabling, dynamic and inspiring for the development of solutions to global problems in the fields of energy, environment and current patterns of development, which are largely unsustainable. The Institute has grown substantially over the years, particularly, since it launched its own research activities and established a base in New Delhi, its registered headquarters. The central element of TERIâ€™s philosophy has been its reliance on entrepreneurial skills to create benefits for society through the development and dissemination of intellectual property. The strength of the Institute lies in not only identifying and articulating intellectual challenges straddling a number of disciplines of knowledge but also in mounting research, training and demonstration projects leading to development of specific problem-based advanced technologies that help carry benefits to society at large.",

Vision: The Trust vision is to ensure social, economic and environmental sustainability for remote Himalayan village communities through environmental and social action which leads to greater community well-being. Our mission is to support and strengthen grassroots initiatives undertaken by local groups or individuals which promote conservation of natural resources and lead to an improvement in the quality of life of the community within their natural habitat and cultural setting. The Himalaya Trust encourages communities to develop a sense of pride and an attitude of trusteeship towards their unique ecological, intellectual and cultural heritage. THT explores locally feasible economic solutions for mountain communities as an alternative to the persistent migration to the plains for employment, To revitalize traditional knowledge of communities and practices of mountain cultures essential for their well being and social and economic stability, To strengthen and energize grassroots institutions to take action to reinforce and enrich their natural biodiversity and water sources through micro-watershed planning. We are proud that the founder of the Organization, Mr. Nalni Jayal is considered to be the motivating force in the establishment of the Environment Ministry in India and in close collaboration with the then Gvoernment, was credited with the establishment of all of our country wild life and biodiversity sanctuaries. Associated with the work, there are interventions on Health, Education, Agriculture and Water. Oral testimony that gave us a peek into our past and the deployment of Community Radio project, pioneered by THT in the region. THT has partnered donors like The Hans foundation, Tata Trust, HIMMOTTHAN Society, Swajal, WWF, UNDP, Ministry of Environment & Forests, PANOS London, UNESCO, Equal Access, World Space USA Room to Read, Terre des Hommes, UGVS-IL&FS, GIZ etc. THT has been focused on activities based on community needs, hence, implemented many modest but successful projects in Uttarakhand. Community Radio, Intensive Agriculture, PIL on Environmental issues and dealing on the ground, Oral Testimonies are some of our success stories along with Communication and Culture program.",

INCLEN is dedicated to improving the health of disadvantaged populations, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, by promoting equitable healthcare based on the best evidence of effectiveness and the efficient use of resources. At national level, the INCLEN units work closely with the Government of India and State Governments. INCLEN has formal MOU with Indian Council of Medical Research, and Government of Haryana. INCLEN has also strong and active linkages with several national and international universities, research organizations and professional associations. INCLEN has also established a demographic, development, health and environmental surveillance site (DDESS) - SOMAARTH (Synergizing Economic Development and Comprehensive Health) in Palwal district of Haryana, about 80 km from Delhi. SOMAARTH DESS site is comprised of 51 villages with about 200,000 populations. Several community based projects are underway in this DESS site. The Data Management Unit at INCLEN Executive Office has a senior program officer, one program officer, one junior statistician and two data assistants. INCLEN has state of art computing facilities with a large number of computers, two dedicated servers, lease lines for high speed internet connectivity both in Delhi office in SOMAARTH DDESS, and data management software, including statistical analysis software (STATA 12.0 SE). INCLEN has moved in to paperless data collection approach for the last 1.5 years. INCLEN has developed in-house software for analysis of qualitative data â€“IQ-DAS (INCLEN Qualitative Data Analysis Software) based on our experience of last 18 years. All qualitative data is now analyzed using this software. INCLEN has now added a spatial epidemiology data analytic capability with a program officer in medical geography. INCLEN has successfully completed four different research studies recently viz., determinants of under nutrition in children (in 6 states of India); assessing the cold chain system (in Kerala, Gujarat and Bihar states of India covering 27 districts and all cold chain points) and Neuro-developmental disabilities (NDDs) among children (in 5 zones across 10 states of India).",

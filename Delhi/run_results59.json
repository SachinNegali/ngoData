OneWorld Foundation India is a registered Indian entity that works in the field of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) for social and sustainable development. While OneWorld was registered as a non-profit company under Section 25 in 2008, OneWorld began operations in India in 2000 as the South Asian Centre of the OneWorld International Foundation. In its pioneering role as a knowledge enabler, OneWorld creates aggregates, manages and disseminates information and knowledge on a gamut of development issues â€“ from grassroots voices to international policy deliberations â€“ to an array of audiences through its group of portals, editions and thematic channels. OneWorld believes that information can be an enabler for development and empowerment. Based on this belief, OneWorld works collaboratively with partners to create ICT-assisted innovations and appropriate e-tools for knowledge management to reach development benefits to grassroots communities. In the process, OneWorld develops solutions to integrate contextual geographical, cultural, temporal and linguistic parameters in knowledge management. Mobile telephony led-voice and text-based communication, and social networking for positive change communication are other areas in which OneWorld is working to foster content, connectivity, capacity building, convergence and coordination. OneWorld has expertise in both developing technology solutions like websites, knowledge management platforms, mobile applications, IVRS-based toll free services and info-kiosks, and leveraging communication mediums like online spaces, social media, research and documentation, and print, radio and video. The body of work covers agriculture, children, disaster management, education, environment, e-governance, health, livelihood, rural development, social justice, urban development, water and sanitation, women empowerment, etc. Besides, OneWorld through its communication and research initiatives cover all of the country. OneWorld has partnered with governments, UN bodies, multilateral organisations, research institutions, corporates and the civil society. These range from the Government of India (Ministry of Information & Broadcasting, Ministry of Law and Justice, Ministry of Rural Development), UN agencies (UNDP, UN Women, UNESCO, UNICEF), the World Bank, foreign organisations (Department for International Development, Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, Japan International Cooperation Agency), educational institutions (IIT-Mumbai and UK-based Institute of Development Studies); companies like Intel, Cisco and BT, and NGOs like TERI and Akshaya Patra.

   "detailsOfAchievement": "Operation ASHA serves a population of 1.5 million slum-dwellers in five states and is expanding rapidly. It has devised a new patient-friendly system for TB treatment. The treatment is taken to the doorsteps of the disadvantaged. Treatment centers are established within the community, e.g. in small shops, huts and temples. Centers are located a mile from each other and operated by community providers for 12-16 hours a day. Thus, patients can procure the medicine conveniently, without wasting time, spending money on transport or losing wages. Easy accessibility is supplemented with a robust educational campaign, which is carried out by highly trained counselors, who are also responsible for tracking and eliminating default. All employees are recruited from within the community. So our message is accepted readily. Counselors screen every person and ensure that every suspect undergoes sputum test. Counselors are paid performance linked incentive salaries, which spurs them to do well. Operation ASHA works very closely with Revised National TB Control Programme and uses drugs, hospitals and diagnostic facilities provided by it. Government officials are encouraged to visit the centers and provide feedback, which helps maintain quality. RNTCP also provides a grant under Slum Scheme provided for in NGO Guidelines so each center becomes self-sustaining within two years. Our model has achieved excellent results. In South Delhi where Operation ASHA is a major force, detection rate has increased by 78%. Default is down to nearly 3%, many times less than usual. Thus, Operation ASHA has turned the tap off, preventing MDR. Ken Castro, Assistant Surgeon General and Director, TB Elimination, CDC, USA found our work to be â€œtruly remarkableâ€. High quality does not mean high costs. Operation ASHA practices stringent cost control. The cost of treating a patient for the entire therapy of average seven months is only $15 = $2 a month approximately. The â€œsocial return on investmentâ€ is 22500%. Our investment is matched 25 times by our partners. Operation ASHA has tied up with Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA, which will conduct a randomized control trial, which are considered gold-standard in research. It will assess the impact of Operation ASHA in slum communities. Research department of Microsoft has taken up development of bio-metric devices for Operation ASHA. With these devices, it will be able to track each dose taken by each patient and further improve our results. Operation ASHAâ€™s model has been appreciated world-wide. Prajnopaya Foundation, which is based in Boston, signed an agreement in June 2009 whereby Prajnopaya is raising funds for TB control in India and Operation ASHA has the responsibility of executing the program. Prajnopaya supports the vision of its chief patron, Nobel Laureate His Holiness the Dalai Lama. Having virtually eliminated default, established a cost-effective and replicable model, Operation ASHA is expanding rapidly. It plans to establish 1000 DOTS centers by 2012, which will serve a population of 70 million. It is looking for funding and partnerships to achieve this goal.",

   "detailsOfAchievement": "The Population Foundation of India (PFI), formerly known as Family Planning Foundation, was established by 1970 by a dedicated group of industrialists and population activists led by the late Mr JRD Tata. He guided it as the founder Chairman until his death in 1993, when Dr Bharat Ram, noted industrialist and a founding member of the foundation, became the Chairman of the Governing Board. After Dr Bharat Ramâ€™s demise in 2007, Mr Hari Shankar SInghania took over as the Chairman. The foundation has been in the forefront of non-governmental efforts at population stabilization, establishing a balance between resources, environment and population. Social development, including population stabilization in India, should not, and cannot, remain the sole concern of the Government. It ought to be supported and supplemented by private voluntary enterprises. In this regard, the foundation works in close co-operation and coordination with official agencies and programmes, both at the Centre and the states. In its independent role, it has tried to guide and influence the National Population Policy and serve as a catalytic agent to promote programmes at different levels directed towards the ultimate goal of population stabilization. The foundation supports innovative research and social action to further the cause of population stabilization. It provides a forum for the pooling of experinecs and sharing of professional expertise to strengthen and enlarge the operational base of Reproductive and Child Health (RCH) programmes in India.",

Children participate in all such events and show their talents in the presence of dignitaries and eminent social workers. The centre also celebrates Diwali every year with the children. Sweets, candles and sparklers (other than sound pollutants) are distributed to children. 3) Rotary Club is an active supporter of all the activities at the centre. The Rotarians contribute and support with their time, skills, resources and donations for running the centre. 4) Every year the children are taken out for an educational or spiritual trip to places like Akshardham Temple, Purana Quila, India Gate, Science Museum, Deer Park, etc. 5) Every year the children participate in NSS Annual Day function at LSR and showcase their talent. This also helps them in confidence building as well as improving their creative skills. The foundation also organises multi-purpose Culture-Connect Programs to (1) bring various communities together, (2) give them exposure and experience of our own Indian heritage, (3) encourage them to give back to society and (4) raise funds to fulfil objectives of the foundation. The foundation will be further promoting the upcoming and younger artists (Indian Music and Dance) and connect them with the youth in various schools and colleges. This is an effort to involve the youth in preserving and promoting Indian Art & Culture besides empowering less privileged children & women. We are trying to surmount the deafening cacophony and vulgar lyrics being churned out every day. We are giving them exposure to meaningful lyrics and melodious music. We give them the opportunity to appreciate and develop taste for our own Poetry, Ghazals, Sufi and Classical music.",

Recognizing and strengthening grassroot women leaders - Women Exemplar Program The Program, instituted in 2005, recognizes the contributions of women grassroots leaders, who have, against all odds, excelled and contributed significantly in the areas of Health, Education and Micro-enterprise. Each year, three extraordinary leaders are recognized as Woman Exemplars from among over hundred applications. In addition to the three exemplars, all the shortlisted candidates undergo series of capacity building workshops and individual mentoring plans are conducted to enhance the leadership capacities of the grassroots women leaders. Disaster relief and rehabilitation projects CIIF with the support of CII members have been closely working with the Union and State government to provide relief in disaster-affected geographies across the country.

   "detailsOfAchievement": "â€œTheatre is a continuous processâ€. Formed in 2002, Circle Theatre is meant for theatre of strength, courage and substance. Having the honour of venue opening and premired in â€˜Bharat Rang Mahotsavâ€™ (the International Theatre Festival of NSD), the USP of the organization is the volume of research oriented work of diverse subject incorporates in its productions which lead to an unique record for this organization within brief span of time in the country that, at a row all of its productions stand at par excellence in terms of its â€˜artistic qualityâ€™, â€˜expressionâ€™ and â€˜messageâ€™ of these diverse subjects of plays produced by the organization which concerns the greater public interest (see the production list below), which result many times as â€˜Best Productionâ€™ of the year of Sahitya Kala Parishad, Govt of NCT Delhi, participated in NSDâ€™S International Theatre Festival â€“ â€˜Bharat Rang Mahotsavâ€™ and its Satellite Theatre Festivalâ€™ including other festival of national importance etc. and finally comes to this that in the year of 2009-2010, Circle Theatre, New Delhi is given a Salary Grant (of 10+1) by the Dept. of Culture, Govt. of India. Apart from the main course of activities the circle theatre organizes symposiums and workshops for its actors by inviting resource person from out side for various facets of theatre from time to time which is related to the productions or the individual growth of actors vis-a- vis a systematic practice and training which the organization runs on its own. Circle Theatre offers workshops for others on various subjects of theatre and being invited especially its Artistic Director Mr. Bapi Bose by the various organizations across the country. The organization attends and participates in various theatre festivals, with the objective of using theatre as an instrument for reaching out to people and creating social awareness while simultaneously educating, entertaining and inspiring the masses. Circle Theatre initiates to promote â€˜Young Directorâ€™ for new idea of production. The organization provides the â€˜Technical Supportâ€™ with their excellent technical team to other organizations whenever it is needed. Circle Theatre is a collaborator and an architect of reviving the cityâ€™s Bengali theatre culture by involving Sangeet Natak Akademy, New Delhi with New Delhi Kali Bari, Mandir Marg for organizing the National Theatre Festival of Short Plays â€“ All India Bengali Short Drama Competition in 2008 onwards which is become a â€˜National Eventâ€™, a regular cultural feature of cityâ€™s cultural life in the month of February after â€˜Bharat Rang Mahotsavâ€™ of NSD. For this â€˜National eventâ€™ apart from organizing the festival, Circle Theatre has its sharing of responsibilities, introduced the â€˜Best Production Awardâ€™ and â€˜People Choice Awardâ€™ along with the â€˜Exhibition on Theatreâ€™, â€˜Book Shopâ€™ for Theatre periodicals and Theatre Books, â€˜Ambience Designâ€™ of the Festival and a â€˜Gala Showâ€™ for Prize Distribution ceremony. The organization does humanitarian work for theatre artistes and others in distress. It brings together actors, writers, set-designers, technicians, singers, puppeteers, graphic, designers, video artistes, film producers, cartoonists and musicians, all of whom comprise its core creative team. In spite of its penetrating appeal to the audience, it has always been difficult to run a professional theatre group like ours. However, with our limited resources we have managed to collect 2000 books on theatre, some of which are really rare. These will be useful for a resource centre on theatre with collection of Books, CDs, Photographs, Interviews etc., which we dream to build with assistance from govt. and other interested agency. THE PRODUCTIONS :- The organization is having a unique record of having five productions which have been judged as Best Productions by Sahitya Kala Parishad; Govt of NCT; Delhi or participated in various festivals including NSDâ€™s International Theatre Festival, called Bharat Rang Mahotsav or International Satellite Theatre Festival of NSD. Socrates (2002) - It is based on Socrates, the great philosopher. Itâ€™s a contemporary assessment of Autocracy, Freedom of Thought, Freedom of Expression and again upholding the sanctity of Democracy, law & judiciary, communal harmony and national integration. It had the honour of having the premier as the Venue Opening production at 4th â€˜Bharat Rang Mahotsavâ€™, 2002 etc. Julius Caesar Ke Aakhri Saat Din (2003) & revival in 2008 - A play against Autocracy, War in comparison to the sanctity of Democracy, based on the Great dictator Julius Caesar. It questions about the defence of the country, the society, the culture, the religion, the democracy, the independence and the human rights. But upon establishing in the power the leaders forget the welfare of the people and the society â€“ the human rights are killed first instead. Then what is the way out of such predicament for human society? In the last 2000 years all â€˜Caesarsâ€™ are busy building their â€˜personal property much than anything else. Participated in international theatre festival, 10th â€˜Bharat Rang Mahotsavâ€™, 2008 etc. Ekla Chalo Re (2004) - A play on partition, Gandhiâ€™s assassination and following incidents. Now half a century after that eventful moment we are once again at the arc of a dramatic historical moment where the divisive forces are raising their heads all over again. Introspection of those events in this dramatic work acts as a reminder for those who cares fort the unity of the country and for those who do not care. It talks about the communal harmony and the national integration. Best Production by Sahitya Kala Parishad; Govt of NCT; Delhi, participated in international theatre festival, 7th â€˜Bharat Rang Mahotsavâ€™, 2005, participated in â€˜Best Plays of the Yearâ€™, 2005 organized by Sahitya Kala Parishad; Govt of NCT; Delhi etc.. Pratham Parth (2006) - â€“ Based on dexterous episode of Mahabharat and a subaltern introspection of Karn, the Great warrior. If Karnâ€™s childhood would have been normal, well nurtured, the story of Mahabharat would have been different. The premise is itâ€™s a case of lost childhood so take care of your little child donâ€™t push them away. Best Production by Sahitya Kala Parishad; Govt of NCT; Delhi, participated in international theatre festival - 9th â€˜Bharat Rang Mahotsavâ€™, 2007 and its â€˜Satellite Theatre Festivalâ€™ participated in Best Plays of the Year, 2007 organized by Sahitya Kala Parishad; Govt of NCT; Delhi etc. Parampurush (2008) - A contemporary introspection of Sri Ramakrishna Paramhamsadev, the embodiment of the harmony of world religions and Swami Vivekananda. The play looks into the man who could transform the mutual hatred to mutual love with the philosophy of Shiv Gyan Me Jeev Seva. Nothing could resist him to preach that Lord Shiva is living in the souls of the every human being. Now despite of Ramakrishnaâ€™s unique message after â€˜Mumbai blastâ€™ the message of the play becomes so relevant to the Indian society especially and as well as the Global terrorism too. Best Production by Sahitya Kala Parishad; Govt of NCT; Delhi, honour of having the premier at â€˜Mohan Rakesh Natya Samarohâ€™, organized by Sahitya Kala Parishad; Govt of NCT; Delhi, 2009, and honour of having the premier of Venue Opening production at 12th â€˜Bharat Rang Mahotsavâ€™, 2010 etc.",

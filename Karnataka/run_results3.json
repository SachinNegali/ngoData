        "detailsOfAchievement": "The Centre for Human Genetics is a centre for research, education and training in areas which lie at the interface of modern genetics and medicine. Besides research and teaching, the Centre provides comprehensive clinical services for a range of genetic disorders and inborn errors of metabolism. During the past few years the Centreâ€™s scientists and clinical geneticists have provided diagnostic and counselling services to over 15,000 families with genetic disorders. With generous assistance from the Government of Karnataka, the Centre provides these services free of cost to BPL families seen at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health and other government-funded hospitals. The Centre conducts intensive short-term courses and training programmes in human disease genetics which routinely attract young scientists and clinicians from across the country. The Centre has been assisting medical colleges in several district headquarters in Karnataka to set up their own basic facilities for diagnosis and management of the more common genetic disorders. The Centreâ€™s scientists are also engaged in developing low-cost strategies for diagnosis and therapy suitable for local requirements. Under its â€˜Public Engagement with Geneticsâ€™ programme, CHG provides assistance to parent support groups for families with genetic disorders. CHG is involved in improving public awareness of the ethical, legal and societal issues surrounding advances in human genome research. The Centre is located in a 20-acre institutional area within a 80-acre Biotech Park being developed by the Government of Karnataka in Electronics City in south Bangalore. IBAB, an institution specializing in Bioinformatics, and a Bio-IT Centre promoted jointly by the Ministry of IT, Government of India and the Government of Karnataka are next door. The Centre for Human Genetics is an academic partner in the Bio-IT Centre, which is equipped with NGS platforms. BBC, the Bangalore Bioinnovation Centre, is located behind CHGâ€™s laboratories. There are two health universities and several major hospitals in south Bangalore, among them NIMHANS, St. Johns and the Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Heath. There is also a â€œHealth Cityâ€ coming up nearby, which includes Narayana Hrudayalaya and the new Mazumdar-Shaw Cancer Center. CHGâ€™s present location therefore provides obvious advantages for postgraduate teaching and research in Human Genetics. A post-doctoral Fellowship programme in Paediatric Genetics is being conducted by the Centre in collaboration with the Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health. The Centre offers a two-year Masterâ€™s degree programme in Human Disease Genetics under the aegis of Mysore University. The latter is a blend of formal teaching, laboratory exercises, case studies and activity-based learning. It provides hands-on training in human genetics via a combination of cell and molecular biology, genetics and clinical biology, including the use of statistical techniques. This interdisciplinary course has been designed to bridge the gap between clinical and basic biology.",

        "detailsOfAchievement": "The activities of CNBRCD concentrate mainly on natural biological resources, especially microbial inoculants. It is very well known that the use of heavy dose of fertilizers and pesticides is hazardous to soil, animal and human health. Hence, use of biologicals in place of chemicals is recommended in sustainable agriculture. The outstanding work on beneficial microorganisms, especially arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) carried out at CNBRCD is recognized nationally and internationally. Earlier projects at CNBRCD brought out that 50 per cent of chemical fertilizers for crop plants can be reduced through microbial inoculation. Microbial inoculants also helped in raising quality seedlings in the nursery, revegetation of degraded forests and the biocontrol of soilborne plant pathogens. This in turn increased the income generation of the beneficiaries. The beneficiaries of the results of these research are marginal farmers especially women, schedule caste and tribal people. CNBRCD has developed protocols for the mass production of AMF by commercial entrepreneurs, as well as by farmers. CNBRCD which started in 2001 has completed 18 research projects funded mostly by GOI and has 3 ongoing projects now. It has published 109 research papers in national and international journals, 49 review articles and book chapters and 06 books related to microbiology. The trustees are actively involved as Reviewers of national and international research papers and research projects, Members of Editorial Board of several journals, Advisory and Expert Committee Members of several GOI funding agencies, Members of National Academies Science Academies Education Panel (thus taking science to students and young teachers) and Recipients of several national and international awards. For ex., the Chairman of CNBRCD is the only scientist from India invited by European Union to contribute to Global Soil Biodiversity Atlas released at Belgium in May 2016. So far 08 students have completed their Ph.D. and M.Phil. degree from CNBRCD and 3 are currently working for their Ph.D. degree. CNBRCD has trained a large number of scientists from India and other developing countries in methods used in AMF research. It is also maintaining the germplasm bank of AMF and supplies starter culture on request to students, scientist and farmers. Young scientists, extension workers and farmers were educated about the advantages in the use of ecofriendly microbial inoculants in place of chemicals like reduction in the cost of cultivation; reduction in environmental pollution and improvement in soil health. Though research on soil microorganisms is done in many laboratories in the country, rarely the benefit of the same reach the farmers. CNBRCD in addition to research has taken the results of research to the end user, the farmer. The work done at CNBRCD has brought beyond doubt that use of microbial inoculants can not only improve productivity in plants important in agriculture, horticulture and forestry but also reduce environmental pollution. CNBRCD is recognized as a Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (SIRO) by Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR-GOI) and has all the laboratory facilities, glass house and field facilities for carrying out the experiments.",

We are into research, capacity building, advocacy on child rights issues among general public, peoples representatives and media to monitor the situation of children and labour to protect the rights of children for survival, protection, development and participation. After a field based action research, CRT motivated Govt of Karnataka to declare Child Rights Grama Sabhas to be conducted every Nov. every year to take stock of the situation of children at Grama Panchayat level and to find solutions locally. After thorough study on the pattern of question raised on the floor of Vidhana Sabha and Parishath, CRT motivated legislators of Karnataka to develop Karnataka State Legislators Forum for Child Rights. CRT is providing information and motivation to the legislators to take up child centred issues to the Assembly and Council. These motivated the Karnataka Legislative Council to conduct Special Session on Child Rights in the year 2014. CRT is the Secretariat of Karnataka Child Rights Observatory (KCRO) and through this conducting Child Rights Parliament from district to state level and child representatives meet chief Minister in Nov. every year to raise their issues. This effort is supported by UNICEF. CRT is currently involved in promoting right to education awareness among the rural masses and preventing child marriages and child sexual abuse. CRT is the nodal agency for ChildLine 1098 for Bengaluru. CRT is conducting trainings to NGOs, media, Govt personnel, students and peoples representatives on various child rights issues, such as Juvenile Justice Act, RTE Act, Prohibition of Child Maririages Act, POCSO, National Policy for Children, etc., apart from the UN CRC. CRT works closely with the Govt of Karnataka in various advocacy and public education programmes to uphold the rights of children. We are also invited by the Govt and NGOs and VOs in various consultations related to child centered issues. Govt of Karnataka has recognized the works of CRT and has conferred Karnataka State Child Welfare Award in the year 2008.",

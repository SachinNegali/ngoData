Recruitments are done basically with the people of MFI background with qualification of min H.S. for P.O. to above for all other positions, right now by reference of known people of MFI, but in future through newspaper advertisement. MIS Decision making, Administrative, outreach, portfolio and financial data is generated regularly and control system used it regularly. The micro credit MIS formats are more or less standardized and covers information like no of out reach, security and loan disbursed, weekly realizable and realized etc. Now Sampark has computerized MIS. Education Every one knows that education is the backbone of the nation. Lack of education no development and upliftment of the society is possible. Recognizing the importance of providing education services to the masses , SAMPARK has taken several concrete stapes in the direction . One such step is that SAMPARK has formed child guardian committees which strives for self sustenance for educational system .Remedial classes for outgoing children are another significant measure undertaken by SAMPARK . About 51 children in the age group of 5 to12 years of age including majority of female children were admitted in formal school . SAMPARK provided books for poor intelligent students . Health and Sanitation Health is another major of concern where SAMPARK has maximized its efforts . SAMPARK health program is completely community driven and ensures diversification in health , sanitation and nutrition The core activities in this sector by SAMPARK are Identification of potential village health guides and providing them training and exposure . Propagating and sanitation and cleanliness habits . Construction of toilets and bathrooms . Subsidized distribution of safe drinking water . Maintenance and beautification of tubewell . Organizing regular health camp . Orientation on awareness building training on personal hygiene and Sanitation and nutrition no 326 Free medical checkup no 126 CAPACITY BUILDING Over the past few years, Sampark has learnt that capacity building of the staff is one of the key components of its development strategy . Hence, training has been considered as an important strategy to enhance the proficiency and expertise of the staff. It never compromises on the capacity building of its staff. Micro Credit Programme Micro credit has been universally recognized as one of the most powerful tools to emancipate people from the shackles of destitution and hunger. Poor women create self-employment with loans taken from Sampark making them selfreliant. Sampark norm of lending out loans has been made extremely poor friendly so that it can bring more and more people under its purview. The credit deliverance is made through the methodology of joint liability group model.",

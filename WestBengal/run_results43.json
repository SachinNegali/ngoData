Canning is the largest biodiversity area of world near Sunderbans, the home of Royal Bengal tigers and variety of snakes. JSSC constantly adopted new approaches to reach the local people over these years to eradicate superstitions, ignorance and educate them about their environments. JSSC published books on snake maps of 24 Paraganas, Bengal and India. Over the years JSSC published books on superstitions, common diseases etc. During 2008 and 2012, JSSC surveyed snakebite victims in all the districts in 24 Paragans covering more than 9 Lacs families. In 2013, JSSC started a after school program for young school going children in their neighbourhood. And also did setup medical camps to check general health of the children, giving vaccines, eye examinations etc.Â",

   "detailsOfAchievement": "Gobardanga KATHA PRASANGA is out and out a fulltime theatre troupe and one of the most eminent groups of Bengali theatre fraternity, that has been devoted to the production and performance of theatre since 2000 and it would not be any exaggeration to say that KATHA PRASANGA, through all its successful stage performances in West Bengal as well as outside West Bengal, Seminars, Natya Utsav, and Theatre Workshops, has won a place of distinction in the theatre movement. This institution firmly believes that despite mixed influences of lost of media, stage performances of theatre definitely leave a lasting impression upon the present generations and can mould and nature the mind feelings of the theatre-lovers, to a great extent.However, KATHA PRASANGA starts its journey through the productions â€˜Sankrantiâ€™ in the year 2001. Then presented itâ€™s notable productions, like â€˜Devotar Grassâ€™ (Rabindra Nathâ€™s pome), â€˜Ukiler Buddhiâ€™ â€˜Monikathaâ€™ (Workshop based production with school children), â€˜Samudra Sowarâ€™, â€˜One-Twoâ€™, â€˜Ukiler Budhiâ€™, â€˜Asukha Sattyamâ€™, â€˜Fakir Sekher Galpoâ€™, â€˜Ghoton Kothay?â€™, â€˜Saatmaar Palowanâ€™ etc.However, Kathaprasanga has laid especial emphasis upon mime production too because mime being a very powerful art form, has an universal message of its own. Keeping this in mind we made use of it in our productions i. e. Ramayana, Man & Machine, Thief, Weight Lifter, Blind, etc. and this successions of plays were a success. Since 2005, KATHAPRASANGA organizing school children workshops which as part of the Theatre In Education. (T.I.E) programme, under the active guidance of Rudraprasad Sengupta & Swatilekha Sengupta (Nandikar, Kolkata). KATHAPRASANGA performed many prestigious Natya Festivals like Nandikarâ€™s National Theatre Festival, Natya Mela (organised by State Natya Academy, Govt. of West Bengal), Banipur Loko Utsav, etc. and others Natya Utsav in West Bengal. Now it is a reputed and reknowed Theatre Group in West Bengal. KATHA PRASANGA fervently believes that theatre is a platform where all art media can be and have to be used to intensify the message of the theatre, to make a support with the audience. So, our overall approach is never to copy any group or style blindly. But to stimulate the mind & consciousness of the generations of today who are going to be the shaper or the agent fo the future, before whom the abstract world of higher thoughts should be presented in a simple way through artistic presentations of personal, social & concrete situations. So that this humanistic art form would encourage their theatre activity, boost their awareness of values and create greater consciousness of their sense of culture, beauty, harmony and our quiet essential unity all sorts of diversities.",

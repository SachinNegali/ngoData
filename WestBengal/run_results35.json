        "detailsOfAchievement": "Adhiti means â€˜Adhyankariâ€™ (The Learners) in Bengali. Few learners from different colleges in Kolkata have assembled in a small place of Kalighat, South Kolkata, for practicing reading poems, stories, plays of different writers in Bengali literature in the year of 1998. At the same time the members have planned to favour the slum children residing in the adjacent area of Kalighat. The junior members were helped by their seniors in developing their school studies and sometimes all the members practiced rhymes, poems and the story telling together during the recess. Eminent performers from different cultural fields were glad to receive the invitation from the members of Adhiti and were interested enough to enrich the group. Some of the senior members have joined in the departments of Drama and Dance at Rabindra Bharati University, Kolkata, in order to enhance their knowledge. Adhiti began to steadily emphasize on story telling, after witnessing the performance of â€˜Kahani ki Manchanâ€™ by the Repertory Company of National School of Drama under the direction of Debendraraj Ankur, ex Director of the school in the National Theatre Festival organized by Nandikar,Kolkata. Later Adhiti organized performances on rhymes, story telling and play reading at the auditoriums in Kolkata regularly. The members of the group enriched themselves by observing the presentations of the eminent performers like Praidp Ghosh, Partha Ghosh, Saoli Mitra and others. Singers like Smt. Suchitra Mitra, Gita Ghatak, Arghya Sen have also participated in our programs. Members have improved themselves through these performances. Then Adhiti has received invitations for preparing productions for the children sections of Doordarshan Kendra, Kolkata. Adhiti is one of the primary groups in Kolkata to perform story telling or Galpoavinay in Bengali. Adhitis GalpoAvinay was and is still highly applauded not only in Kolkata but also in different districts of West Bengal. The group has received invitations from different Colleges, Universities and other Institutions during the hundred fiftieth birth anniversary of Rabindranath Thakur, to perform GalpoAvinay. At the same time, Adhiti is busy for the fortification and the development of the slum children with different activities. The members have performed the first full length theatre production, â€˜Mahajatra Botikaâ€™ based on a famous American Play, â€˜Arsenic and Old laceâ€™ by Joseph Kesselring. The play was highly applauded by the spectators of Kolkata and the Critics had appreciated even. The play was produced in the year of 2011 and ran more than two years. Then Adhiti has produced a compilation of short stories from Rabindranath Thakur, â€˜Ek Guccha Galpoâ€™, by name. The eminent artist Bijaylakshmi Burman( by invitation) , along with two other senior popular actors, Debashis Roychowdhury and Arunita Roychowdhury (from the Group) have performed the play. Now Adhiti is preparing the play â€˜Rakta Pushpaâ€™, written by the famous playwright, Mahesh Elkunchwar. The playâ€™s English adaptation, â€˜Flower of Bloodâ€™, was translated by Sarmila Moitra. Apart from the cultural activities Adhiti is always interested to serve for the betterment of the people and the society.",

In an Endeavour to secure the life of the poor and deprived people and to give them a sense of financial security , LIC ( Life Insurance Corporation of India) had launched a Special policy named â€œJivanmadhurâ€ and had provided our NGO the opportunity to serve the people. According to this policy any person with low income can also open a policy in his or her name with a nominal amount of INR 100/-per month. The policy allows the person to get the entire deposited amount along with the interest after the tenure is completed. And if the person meets accidental death, the nominee would be given an appropriate sum of money without interest within 7days. We are glad to announce that around 2,000 people living in various parts of Kolkata and North 24 Parganas have joined under these Scheme and we are still working in areas of South 24 Parganas , East Medinipur, West Medinipur and Burdwan. We are imparting Free Formal Education along with singing and drawing courses to the BPL Children Under this project we have been able to benefit around 320 BPL Children. With help of â€˜New Barrackpore Basti Unnoyon Samitiâ€™ andâ€™ Baguiati Sanskritrikâ€™ Forum we have been able to run school in rail basti and also in Different wards of Rajarhat Municipality and Bira municipality Rail Basti has also become a part of our educational project.. And we are glad to announce that in this course we have been able to establish 10 schools related to singing â€“dancing & drawing and heading towards a new and better India. We have been organizing various tree plantation campaigns in various parts of the city to help create a greener surrounding.

We arrange workshop to guide the common mass from the ill effect of Arsenic polluted water and the ways to treat water. We also try to educate and encourage people for Terrace Water Harvesting during the monsoon.

A Chamber which started in Kolkata in 1925, and played a significant role in Indiaâ€™s Freedom struggle, today inspiringly continues to grow across states and regions, and is adhering more strongly to itâ€™s primary aim of creating a conducive and sustainable environment to enable social, industrial and economic growth of the country. As the Indian Chamber takes rapid and confident strides towards itâ€™s One Hundredth Year, there will certainly be new challenges and goals on the way, but the Chamber is determined to continuously adapt, change, innovate and experiment to ensure that it records stories of greater achievements and excellence",

The Womens Income Generation Centre (WIGC) works towards poverty alleviation. WIGC supports the rural and urban poor especially women, tribals, scheduled castes, other backward classes and minorities for their economic self-reliance. In its constant endeavor to increase the economic strength of the women of rural areas and poor urban families, WIGC is marching towards the transformation and reformation of the working condition of these particular women who have long been deprived of common minimum facilities in their respective field of works. It is evident that the emerging trends of global market expels our traditional-styled artisans particularly those who are in the handloom and handicrafts sector (or Home Crafts Sectors). This emerging threat or phenomena is, in fact, a great challenge to our crafts persons or artisans. Here, the most effected group of people who suffers a lot is the womenfolk in rural and semi urban areas. Consequently, the age-long traditional products have become extinct from the market scene leaving our crafts persons with a bare hand. Their economic condition falls to the ground. Though some rural development and other programmes do exist, their support to these helpless people, particularly women, their numbers are dismal. Now, it is high time to rediscover the talents of our crafts persons/ artisans particularly women and to upgrade their unique skills with a view to strong economic self-dependence which is essential for their social, economic and vocational rehabilitation in the community. Keeping in mind the primary objectives of the Organisation, that is, to work at best for the welfare of women and child in particular and youths in general. WIGC has, since inception, been engaging in Women Empowerment, Promotion of SHGs, Skill upgradation vocational Trainings, Computer Education, Community Asset making, Social Welfare, Health & Family Welfare, Health & Sanitation, Art & Culture, Environment, Games & Sports, Employment Generation, etc. In the light of WIGCâ€™s growing concern over helping weaker section, the Organisation has a wide coverage of women in the State in its overall activities specially designed and implemented for them. Since its early years of inception, WIGC has been imparting various vocational trainings and skill upgradation courses to women all the year round. Women of every community coming from different parts of the State actively participate in the welfare programmes of WIGC apart from the training programmes. The Organisation has received the District Youth Award (1997-98), UNDP Award (2000) and State Youth Award (2004).

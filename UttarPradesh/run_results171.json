This study is trying to find the reason for those diversities and to determine valued recommendations for better use of computers to enhance studentsâ€™ academic achievement. The computer is an effective tool; it can do good things or bad things, depending on the person who uses it. This study tried to find from the statistical analysis a better use of the computer in terms of who, when, where, how, and what. The ELS:2002 study includes data on more than 15 thousand tenth-grade students in the sample; this also increases the significance of the study. Definitions and Terms ELL, English language learner Research studies referred to non-native English speaking students as limited English proficiency (LEP), English as a second language (ESL), English for speakers of other languages (ESOL), or English as a foreign language (EFL). This report uses ELL to refer to students whose native language was not English. Computer Use Computer use in this study includes all the computer-related questions in ELS:2002 teachersâ€™ and studentsâ€™ surveys.

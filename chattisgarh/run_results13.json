        "detailsOfAchievement": "GENVP has established itself as one of the leaders in social change and developmental interventions in the state of Bihar. The greatest achievement of the institutions is that it has been able to organize thousands of dalits in to community based organizations and capacitate them for claiming their rights following non-violent and democratic methods. The efforts of the organisation in the fields of women empowerment, provisions of basic services to the deprived communities, gender mainstreaming and ending the discriminations practiced gender wise and caste wise across the state. The organization in this process has also established a strong networking relationship with the government departments as well as with a large number of civil society organizations. GENVP has a remarkable achievement in addressing the challenging issue of early marriage & early pregnancy. The organization has been successful in working on the issue among the community as well as the government officials. For addressing the problems of youth, NRHM provides Youth Friendly Health Services to promote SRH of young people. But there was no such implementation in Bihar. GENVP made state level advocacy with Ministry and govt. officials of health Dept. on the issue. After advocacy with the cooperation of the Civil surgeon of Nalanda District, orientation was given to all the MOICs and paramedical officers of Nalanda District on YFHS. As a result of which YFHS were initiated in the PHCs, which was yet a big challenge. 2.GENVP has undertaken another such challenge by initiating the SRH based life skills in the conservative community of Nalanda District. A training module has been developed for Life skills on adolescent SRH in collaboration with MAMTA health Institute for Mother & Child. The headmasters and teachers of government secondary schools of Nalanda District were given SRH based life skills orientation. It was a great achievement for GENVP that the District Education Officer accepted the Life Skill module and government schools incorporated the session in their daily routine of the classes. 3. GENVP has also shown significant achievement in working on declining sex ratio in Bihar. Prior to the efforts made by the organization, there was no initiative for PCPNDT act, but after the intervention of GENVP, remarkable changes have taken place. With the cooperation of GENVP, government has developed a format for PCPNDT, which is being followed by health Dept. for all the districts of Bihar. GENVP has provided orientation to the MOIC and health functionaries and have also sensitized them for birth registration in 2 blocks of Patna Distrct. After the orientation, the Phulwari Sharif and Daniyawan Block has emerged out as a model PHC, setting an example to other PHCs. The organization has also involved the community based resource groups for spreading the message to promote the birth of girl child in the community.",

At present, this program provides services in 2 blocksâ€”Dalsinghsarai and Vidyapati Nagarâ€”to a population of around 4 lakh. The cornerstone of our approach is active case finding through an in-field screening tool administered by ASHA. The first prong is to mobilize community to identify symptoms of TB. This generates referrals from the community itself with a list of possible people to be evaluated. The second prong is to strengthen ASHA to collect these referrals, screen them, and support them through diagnosis and treatment. These ASHA assume role of a patient enabler and advocate. The final prong is engagement with stakeholders, including public health system, panchayati raj, political representatives, to bring ownership in the process and affect policy. We have supported more than 1500 TB patients through treatment till now. With our collaborator Bill Thies at Microsoft Research, we piloted a mobile based treatment adherence technology called 99DOTS. This has been adopted by the RNTCP amongst the range of choices offered to the patients for adherence. Last year, we initiated a maternal and neonatal health project in Dalsinghsarai. Our approach here is similar: strengthen ASHA and ANM, and empower community. The former is aimed at ensuring early registration, complete ANC, safe delivery, and quality PNC. An equal focus in on engaging with community through mahila mandal and community counselors. Community counselor is a tribe of women who take initiatives in the community; for example, a woman who accompanies all labouring woman in her tola to the hospital. We envision them as community beacons who bring the right practices and knowledge in the community while acting as a bridge as well between the program and community. Mahila Mandal is our awareness vehicle which leverages participatory learning to promote best practices in maternal and neonatal health. TB case detection rate in our catchment area is around 125 per lakh population, which is double of Bihar average",

        "detailsOfAchievement": "Jaiprabha came into being on 26 January 1980 when a group of consientious, educated and socially sensitive women decided to pitch in their mite for the vast numbers of underprivileged sections of Indian society, especially women and chileren. Initial work began in Bhagalpur and soon Jaiprabha moved to Kalhajore village in Bounsi Block, one of the most underdeveloped blocks in Banka district. In 1980-83, when work expanded, Jaiprabha was registered under the Societies Registration Act n 25 March 1983. The registered office of the Society is in Bhagalpur and the project office in Kalhajore village, strategically located in the project area comprising 30 villages in an area of 40 sq. kilometres. From addressing the development issues of women initially, the role and focus of Jaiprabha has expanded to encompass the entire community in an integrated manner bringing in qualitative changes in the lives of the people through improved farming techniques, irrigation for agriculture, facilitating potable water, and awareness on sanitation, health and nutrition. The primary focus is on education of children with a positive bias for girl children. This bias has been received very well by the community and has led to an incredible reversal of sex ratio. As against a sex ratio of 863:1000 in 1984, it has changed to the present ratio of 1026:1000 in the 0-5 years age group. Jaiprabha has quality infrastructure to ensure credible programme implementation. In 2007, Jaiprabha extended its services to the urban children in the slums of Bhagalpur through a state-of-the-art school. Thematic areas of intervention : Jaiprabha has grouped its activities in four major thematic areas with an integrated development approach as follows : . Early Childhood Development and Education . Health, Sanitation and Nutrition . Livelihood and Ecology . Social Research and Project Evaluation Core Programmatic Focus : Universal Education : Jaiprabha believes that the ills of a society can be successfully addressed if all children of the nation are properly educated. The problems of child labour, child marriage and related issues are manifestations of the lack of education. It believes that the rightful place of a child is the school and that all children must enjoy the rights to survival, development, protection and participation. Towards this end, Jaiprabha implements the Universal Education Programme in its project area by promoting an integrated approach that develops not only the cognitive skills but also skills in fine and performing arts along with soft skills such as personality development. Over 1500 children receive quality pre-school training and orientation from Jaiprabha 23 pre-schools, located close to their homes. Jaiprabha runs a free model high school in Kalhajore village providing state-of-the-art educational facilities to over 500 children, focusing on total development of children, with facilities for sports and games, crafts, cultural programmes and vocational skill-training. Village Development : The primary activities are formation of womens groups, farmers groups, resource-mapping, facilitating appropriate natural resource and watershed management and agriculture promotion for sustainable village economy development. The village economy development programmes focus on understanding the varied topography, unproductive soil texture and various methods of irrigation to improve farming cycles and practices. A check dam, deep wells, and a large network of irrigation canals have ensured that villagers do not have to depend only on monsoons. Jetropha, a source for alternative fuel, has been planted on a large scale as a strategy to make productive use of barren village land. Jaiprabha has a professional vocational training centre for school children, women and youth of the villages who seek careers in ready-made garment production. Community Health : People health is a matter of great concern and a daunting task for Jaiprabha. Primary health care services are backed up by community health interventions for bringing about awareness and change in hygiene practices. Jaiprabha is running primary health facility at Kalhajore to offer scientific and appropriate medical care at an affordable cost. Various preventive and promotive health care services undertaken through a team of full-time health workers include facilitating reproductive and child health services, conducting base-line studies to target health interventions, monitoring the growth of children and addressing issues of malnutrition, primary vision and immunization. Potable water was a major problem, which was met through installation of over 130 hand-pumps ensuring the supply of safe drinking water to the entire population. Womens Self-Help Groups : Womens empowerment is the key focus area for Jaiprabha. Till date the whole effort was to form SHGs and not small credit groups. We see this as a vibrant body of women to discuss their social and economic problems and interact with other stakeholders to secure their rights and entitlements. The womens SHGs are active social groups that support, contribute and facilitate the developmental interventions in the village. These groups have empowered women and weaker sections and have released them from the clutches of money lenders. Environmental Protection : Social forestry has been a key initiative to protect the environment in the beginning. Soil conservation and rain water harvesting are the key priority areas to preserve and promote environment and ecology. Vast tracts of land have been greened through inputs such as a check dam, rain water harvesting techniques, community tanks and the use of organic manure. Thousands of saplings have been planted by the community. Discussions with the community for growing medicinal plants and sustainable agriculture practices have seen environmental protection along with improved income. Youth and Childrens Clubs : Jaiprabha supports and protects the interests of children. Its initiatives in promoting universal primary education and developing young minds find expression in forums specially created for children. Children groups have been formed to ensure child protection. These groups have been federated at the village cluster level to act as social watch groups. Childrens groups and youth groups work in tandem as children grow into adolescents and youth. Youth groups are involved in dealing with social issues, vocational training and continuing further studies.",

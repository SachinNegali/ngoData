        "detailsOfAchievement": "ZYKKS was registered under Rajasthan Societies Act 1958, in the year 1979. The ZYKKS is struggling hard for the disadvantaged sections of Rajasthan particularly in Barmer since its inception. The target community to which the organisation is serving for their welfare includes Rural and Urban Youth, Women and Farmers who are either marginalized, disabled or underprivileged sections in context of their economically backwardness. The ZYKKS has conducted numerous community development programs ranging from services deliveries to a Rights Based approach. It has undertook Education, Water Conservation, Livelihood Generation, Dalit Rights, Youth related projects so far from Local, National and International level agencies including â€“ Ministry of Rural development, Ministry of Social Welfare, Ministry of Textiles, Department of Adult Education, OXFAM, ACTION AID, CAPART, Department of Language, DRDA etc. In terms of the personnel, ZYKKS has a workforce of 49 persons including 15 full time persons, 4 part-time persons and 30 volunteers are associated with ZYKKS. Since from its beginning, the organisation is helping the especially BPL families in the form of providing Camel carts. More than 4000 families have been benefited in this regard so faron a minimized cost.The organizationâ€™s main focus is aimed at carrying out community welfare activities for the deprived ones. ZYKKS prepares Camel Carts and supply them to poor people especially BPL people and guide them for taking Bank loans for this as well. The camel-cart was used as a medium of transport for the BPL families which is useful to fetch water from satellite locations. This transport is a boon for the livelihood for rural families in the form of transporting goods, materials and other things from market site to the canals, field, farm etc. The DRDA identified only ZYKKS for marketing their camel carts to BPL families under IRDP Scheme to check the corrupt practices in loaning process. In view of the demand of high quality camel-carts, it covered the rural populace of Barmer district, the ZYKKS also tried to fulfill the needs of other Dessert districts also, where Honorable Prime ministerShri Man Mohan Singh and Honorable Chief Minister of State, Shri Ashok Gehlot applauded this initiative. ZYKKS is associated with LokAdhikar Network (LAN) since 2001. LAN is a network organisation established under the aegis of International Agency â€“ Action Aid. LAN association programme is our second longest programme run ever. ZYKKS has formed 3 voluntary organizations at 3 levels as â€“ Dalit Sangathan, MahilaSangathan and KisanSangathan. These sangathans raise voices in their respective field where and when needed. Dalit Network usually broach upon the Dalit related issues like â€“ access to water, PDS, atrocities etc. MahilaSangathan works for women related issues like â€“ access to water, harassment, domestic violence, dowry, land and property etc. KisaanSangathan (AkaalSangathan) works for Agriculture related issues which includes â€“ Agriculture schemes, NREGA, Drought and other farm related issues. This project covers all the 8 blocks of Barmer through 13 CBOs in 13 Gram Panchayats. The key achievement and impact of the whole intervention programme resulted in effective convergence of intersectoral convergence andZYKKS has linked the rural people to most of the welfare schemes such as â€“ PDS, NREGA, Old Age Pension, Palanhaar, Widow Pension, Annapurna etc. A Water Conservation programme was implemented by ZYKKS with financial support of CAPART in 2008-09. ZYKKS constructed Rain Water Harvesting Structures. Around 10 water tankas were constructed under this water conservation project. These water structures were made in Barmer block. These reservoirs are serving to ST & Minority community of the area. Around 500 persons are benefitting by these tankas. One innovative project of Livelihood generation named as Galicha (Carpet) weaving was carried out by ZYKKS with financial support of OXFAM. In Barmer, Traditionally Carpet weaving work was not existed. The ratio of Sheep population is higher in comparison with other districts of Rajasthan. To introduce Carpet weaving trade in Barmer, ZYKKS implemented an innovative livelihood project with financial support of OXFAM in terms of LOOMs & Training cost support was borne under TRYSEM scheme by DRDA. 750 Youth were trained under this scheme. ZYKKS initiated Literacy campaigns in the year 1989 with the support of National Literacy Mission (NLM), Ministry of HRD, Government of INDIA, New Delhi, where in ZYKKS implemented 30 Literacy centers in Dhorimanna block by involving 900 adults (illiterates). To fulfill the demand of efficient typewriters in various offices of Barmer, a need for a Training center was felt. Hindi & English typewriter machines (which were auction-able) were utilized as a facility provided by the department of Language in the year 1978. As they were not in good condition; ZYKKS repaired these machines and benefited around 3000 youth in this regard. POP led Idol making & Candle making trainings were provided to the young people for their livelihood generation.",

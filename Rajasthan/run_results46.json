        "detailsOfAchievement": "The URMUL Trust is a family of organizations working towards the social and economic betterment of people in the harsh, inhospitable and underdeveloped region of western Rajasthan. Activities vary according to the needs and situation of the specific area, and include group organization, health, education, income generation, research and advocacy. In 1988, the URMUL Trust expanded its activities to the command area of the Indira Gandhi Canal. A branch of the Trust was set up at Bajju in Kolayat tehsil so as to provide community based developmental services to the highly scattered desert population of the area. Initial activities included provision of community based health services to 17 villages, enabling local cattle herders make an occupational shift from animal husbandry to irrigated agriculture forced on them by the advent of the canal, and building up of training infrastructure., it was decided to take on the role of the nodal implementing agency for the Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) in Kolayat tehsil of the district, which expanded the Trustâ€™s work in the Kolayat Block to 113 villages. Work in the canal command area led to the raising of canal related issues such as water logging, salinity, settlement and allotment problems of settlers, deteriorating nutritional status of children, especially girls, in irrigated areas, inter alia. A workshop on the socio-economic impact of the canal in February 1991 was followed by a padayatra (a march) along the entire length of the canal in September, which made these issues into topics of national debate. Today, the Trust is active in 300 villages of Bikaner, Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Churu and Nagour and in a variety of functional areas. An integrated rural development programme is run in 225 villages in this region. A chance meeting with a group of weavers from Jodhpur and Jaisalmer districts in 1988 led to the establishment of the URMUL Bunkar Vikas Samiti, Phalodi, and thereby the extension of the Trustâ€™s activities to this region. The organization was started in 1991 as a self-managed income generation programme for a group of 5 weavers. It has since expanded into an integrated rural development project operative in 10 villages with activities which include health and primary education, support to livelihoods as well as the initial thrust area of income generation with 170 weavers. The most recent intervention of the organisation has been to help the weavers settle in the canal area lands that have been allotted to them. Urmul Trust has played an active and leading role in networking with other organisations in the Thar for disaster mitigation work notably during the droughts of 1986-87, malaria epidemics in 1992, 1995 and flood relief in 1995. In the domain of health, Urmul has helped to establish support organisations like the Rajasthan Voluntary Health Association. Urmul was closely associated with the program design of the Swasthya Karmi programme of the Government of Rajasthan. Presently Urmul a Mother NGOs of RCH project supported by the ministry of Health and Family Welfare, New Delhi.",

        "detailsOfAchievement": "ZYKKS was registered under Rajasthan Societies Act 1958, in the year 1979. The ZYKKS is struggling hard for the disadvantaged sections of Rajasthan particularly in Barmer since its inception. The target community to which the organisation is serving for their welfare includes Rural and Urban Youth, Women and Farmers who are either marginalized, disabled or underprivileged sections in context of their economically backwardness. The ZYKKS has conducted numerous community development programs ranging from services deliveries to a Rights Based approach. It has undertook Education, Water Conservation, Livelihood Generation, Dalit Rights, Youth related projects so far from Local, National and International level agencies including â€“ Ministry of Rural development, Ministry of Social Welfare, Ministry of Textiles, Department of Adult Education, OXFAM, ACTION AID, CAPART, Department of Language, DRDA etc. In terms of the personnel, ZYKKS has a workforce of 49 persons including 15 full time persons, 4 part-time persons and 30 volunteers are associated with ZYKKS. Since from its beginning, the organisation is helping the especially BPL families in the form of providing Camel carts. More than 4000 families have been benefited in this regard so faron a minimized cost.The organizationâ€™s main focus is aimed at carrying out community welfare activities for the deprived ones. ZYKKS prepares Camel Carts and supply them to poor people especially BPL people and guide them for taking Bank loans for this as well. The camel-cart was used as a medium of transport for the BPL families which is useful to fetch water from satellite locations. This transport is a boon for the livelihood for rural families in the form of transporting goods, materials and other things from market site to the canals, field, farm etc. The DRDA identified only ZYKKS for marketing their camel carts to BPL families under IRDP Scheme to check the corrupt practices in loaning process. In view of the demand of high quality camel-carts, it covered the rural populace of Barmer district, the ZYKKS also tried to fulfill the needs of other Dessert districts also, where Honorable Prime ministerShri Man Mohan Singh and Honorable Chief Minister of State, Shri Ashok Gehlot applauded this initiative. ZYKKS is associated with LokAdhikar Network (LAN) since 2001. LAN is a network organisation established under the aegis of International Agency â€“ Action Aid. LAN association programme is our second longest programme run ever. ZYKKS has formed 3 voluntary organizations at 3 levels as â€“ Dalit Sangathan, MahilaSangathan and KisanSangathan. These sangathans raise voices in their respective field where and when needed. Dalit Network usually broach upon the Dalit related issues like â€“ access to water, PDS, atrocities etc. MahilaSangathan works for women related issues like â€“ access to water, harassment, domestic violence, dowry, land and property etc. KisaanSangathan (AkaalSangathan) works for Agriculture related issues which includes â€“ Agriculture schemes, NREGA, Drought and other farm related issues. This project covers all the 8 blocks of Barmer through 13 CBOs in 13 Gram Panchayats. The key achievement and impact of the whole intervention programme resulted in effective convergence of intersectoral convergence andZYKKS has linked the rural people to most of the welfare schemes such as â€“ PDS, NREGA, Old Age Pension, Palanhaar, Widow Pension, Annapurna etc. A Water Conservation programme was implemented by ZYKKS with financial support of CAPART in 2008-09. ZYKKS constructed Rain Water Harvesting Structures. Around 10 water tankas were constructed under this water conservation project. These water structures were made in Barmer block. These reservoirs are serving to ST & Minority community of the area. Around 500 persons are benefitting by these tankas. One innovative project of Livelihood generation named as Galicha (Carpet) weaving was carried out by ZYKKS with financial support of OXFAM. In Barmer, Traditionally Carpet weaving work was not existed. The ratio of Sheep population is higher in comparison with other districts of Rajasthan. To introduce Carpet weaving trade in Barmer, ZYKKS implemented an innovative livelihood project with financial support of OXFAM in terms of LOOMs & Training cost support was borne under TRYSEM scheme by DRDA. 750 Youth were trained under this scheme. ZYKKS initiated Literacy campaigns in the year 1989 with the support of National Literacy Mission (NLM), Ministry of HRD, Government of INDIA, New Delhi, where in ZYKKS implemented 30 Literacy centers in Dhorimanna block by involving 900 adults (illiterates). To fulfill the demand of efficient typewriters in various offices of Barmer, a need for a Training center was felt. Hindi & English typewriter machines (which were auction-able) were utilized as a facility provided by the department of Language in the year 1978. As they were not in good condition; ZYKKS repaired these machines and benefited around 3000 youth in this regard. POP led Idol making & Candle making trainings were provided to the young people for their livelihood generation.",

The Mission: To attain the goal of eliminating the stigma against leprosy affected people, SMKâ€™s activities encompass a host of strategised initiatives, aimed at helping leprosy affected people and their families gain access to education, training them in feasible livelihood options, arranging for micro-finance opportunities, acting as a catalyst by creating and assisting Self Help Groups among them and working with other NGOs to bring hope and purpose in their lives. Until now, the efforts made in the field of social and economic rehabilitation have primarily restricted leprosy affected people to excluded communities and colonies. Rooted in fear, the stigma faced by leprosy affected people is based on the myths and misconceptions about the disease that are widely prevalent in our society. It has, however, been medically proved that leprosy is completely curable and that it is neither contagious nor hereditary. Hence, one of SMKâ€™s key goals is also to raise awareness levels among all sections of society, with a view to ending social and economic discrimination against leprosy affected people everywhere. Major area of work include rehabilitation of leprosy affected men and women and disabled persons living with dignity in the society with their head held high by engaging in the vocational training centre with Income generation activities imparting livelihood areas to the potential differently abled persons. Key achievements include Best NGO award in the field of working for treatment of persons affected with Tuberculosis for 2 years. Ramgarh Reintegration Centre, a new direction taken through reintegration. The differently abled persons equipped with skills adapt appropriately to the needs of adulthood, thereby function as an independent whole-physically and emotionally. The skills project are, Tailoring, computer, mobile repairing, two wheeler servicing and repairing, agriculture, Corrugated box making, incense sticks making, wheat flour grinding, perfume making, dairy, farmer resource centre. Program aims at creating an infrastructure, which ensures smooth graduation from school to the outside world, for young disabled adult and the family. It also aims to ensure training and placements of the young disabled adults in different companies.",

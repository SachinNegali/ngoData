   "detailsOfAchievement": "Primary treatment for alcoholics and drug users TTK Hospital is a pioneering institution working in the field of addiction for more than 29 years. A one month treatment programme is offered to alcoholics and drug users with the goals of helping the clients to achieve total abstinence and also improve their quality of lives. We have also developed a family programme to empower families of addicts. Extended Care At The After Care Centre After care center was started in 1989 to cater to the drug dependent persons who were from younger age group: lacked family support and had no vocational skills or employment. The programme is residential and involves two months stay. The therapy aims at resolving blocks in recovery. Treatment provided here includes medical help; psychological therapy and long term follow-up. Computer education and special programme for families are also offered. From hospital based treatment to Community Supported Recovery The centre devised an innovative Rural Camp programme specially for the villagers making treatment available at their doorsteps. Here the recovery of the clients takes place through the help of the empowered individuals who subsequently transform the village community into a mighty enabling force to combat alcoholism. 5 to 6 rural camps are conducted each year making effective use of the resources available in the community. So far in the last 20 years TTK Hospital has conducted 114 camps in the villages of Tamil Nadu. In each camp 25 to 30 patients have been treated. Relapse prevention and management support Relapse programme addresses the needs of relapsed clients; guides them through their relapse prevention and management programmes and equips them with special skills to handle triggers and other high risk situations so that they can manage their recovery process better. There is a special programme for patients for five days and a parallel programme for family members. Clients who have one or two days of drinking or slip are dealt by providing immediate admission or out patient detoxification. Vocational Rehabilitation at Tejas Many drug dependents have no occupational skills; no work ethics and have difficulty in retaining a job. For them recovery is not possible without vocational training. In 2000 to cater to this need, the TTK Hospital established Tejas, the vocational training center where recovering patients and their family members are provided free training in tailoring and computer education . Besides, there is a packing unit which is a drug free work place where they learn work ethics; earn their living and stabilize recovery. Regional Resource and Training Centre for southern region The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment designated our organization as RRTC for Southern Region . We are mentoring more than 84 centres from Tamil Nadu; Karnataka; Kerala and Andhra Pradesh. We have conducted several training programmes of two days to one month duration. We have also developed the Minimum Standards of Care for the entire country",

   "detailsOfAchievement": "V-Excel Educational Trust is a registered Public Charitable Trust and a professionally run NGO working in the field of Special Education, Rehabilitation and Livelihood development. It was started in 2001 by Dr. Vasudha Prakash, a professional academician and counselor who holds a Doctorate in Special Education from Rutgers University, New Jersey, USA. It is affiliated to Sringeri Sri Sharada Peetham. An experienced multi-disciplinary team of special educators, therapists, counsellors, administrators and skill trainers is committed to ensuring a better future for children and adults with disabilities. V-Excel works with children having mental and developmental disabilities such as Autism, Mental Retardation, Down Syndrome, Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD), Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Behavioural Disorders and Learning Disabilities like Dyslexia. Apart from this we work with teachers, parents, doctors and general public for different services. V-Excel is a lifespan umbrella organization, offering a wide range of services spans across all age groups and all service areas under one roof. We offer the following services - Special School, Counselling, Assessments, Remedial Services, Early Intervention, Sensory Integration, Occupational Therapy, Play-Music â€“Art-Movement Therapies, Vocational Skills Development, Teacher Training, Outreach Programs, and Professional Workshops. V-Excel has eight centres across the country, 3 in Chennai and 1 satellite centre each in Tirunelveli-Erode-Srirangam (Trichy) in Tamil Nadu, and Nashik-Solapur in Maharashtra. We have been getting requests and aspire to set up many such smaller centres in Tier 2 towns. Our ultimate goal is to create an environment where individuals with special needs can grow to lead dignified, independent, and productive lives in society. V-Excelâ€™s unique holistic approach focuses on all-round development of every individualâ€™s abilities, rather than their disabilities. Established as a quality service provider in education and rehabilitation, V-Excel has impacted well over 35,000 individuals with special needs across urban and rural areas. V-Excel and its Founder Dr. Vasudha Prakash have been recipients of many awards. It was a finalist in the prestigious India NGO Awards (in top 12 of the 350 NGOs) in 2015, many Rotary Awards, Woman of Excellence Award, Raj TV, Mother Teresa Award US-Asia Business Forum, Los Angeles, CA, USA. V-Excelâ€™s sincere work in implementing Governmentâ€™s project, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (Education for All), was applauded and showcased at the meet of all state governments. Invited regularly to conduct educational workshops in schools, to give talks at Clubs (e.g. Rotary), to counsel and present at corporates (like Cognizant). V-Excel presented at two international conferences on disabilities - New York and Iceland -for their initiatives in Curative Education. V-Excel has a global perspective, professional approach and determination to facilitate a fuller life for the differently abled, which gives it a distinct edge in the Special Education sector.",

        "detailsOfAchievement": "Centre for Indian Knowledge Systems (CIKS) has been working with the objective of exploring and developing the contemporary relevance and applications of Indian Knowledge Systems focusing in the area of indigenous agriculture. In terms of our work we are focused broadly in the following three areas. 1. Research consisting of farm based research, laboratory based research and participatory research with and in farmers fields 2. Extension including training programmes, trainers training programmes, production of educational and training material 3. Farmers institution building and nurturing a large number of farmers institutions including women farmers who are provided technical support, training and institutional capacity building. THEMATIC FOCUS The thematic focus is on three different areas namely Biodiversity conservation, Sustainable organic agriculture and Vrkshayurveda (Traditional Indian Plant Science). KEY ACHIEVEMENTS 1. RESEARCH Some of the key activities and achievements are Testing and standardization of 25 plants, some animal products, use of natural products for the control of certain pests and diseases. Development of storage forms of biopesticides based on approaches of Vrkshayurveda (Traditional Indian Plant Science), development of organic packages for the cultivation of several crops such as paddy, cotton, ground nut, little millet and specific vegetables. Characterisation of agronomic properties of about 100 indigenous paddy varieties including factors such as pest and disease resistance, drought and flood tolerance, tolerance to salinity. Standardisation of process and setting up of units for production of inputs for sustainable agriculture such as vermicompost, neem seed powder, biopesticides and value added products. Packages for retention and enhancement of soil fertility involving techniques such as biofertilizers, liquid manure, green manure seeds and various other practices. Development of packages for various aspects of seeds and seed technology including production of certified seeds, techniques for seed storage and treatment, techniques for fumigation of seeds to impart resistance to diseases. â€ƒ 2. TRAINING AND EDUCATIONAL MATERIAL We have conducted over a thousand training programs on organic agriculture and over hundred training programs for trainers and about 100,000 farmers have been covered through trainings. We have brought out 125 publications in six languages of which about 1,50,000 copies have been sold or distributed in various parts of India and thirty seven other countries. Sharing of experiences and research findings relating to several topics including the use of animal products in sustainable agriculture, on farm conservation of indigenous seeds, testing and validation of traditional knowledge. 3. FARMERS INSTITUTIONS Spread over eight districts, about 110,000 farming families have benefited from our activities and 10,000 Ha of land has been converted to sustainable agriculture (includes certified and under conversion lands)",

The children in our centres are categorized as children â€˜in need of care and protectionâ€™. They are Runaway children, Street children, Migrant children, Trafficked children, Child labourers, Begging children, Missing children, Special children, victims of physical, sexual, verbal and emotional abuse, Abandoned children, Prisonerâ€™s children, Substance abusing Children, Orphans, Semi orphans, HIV affected children; rescued through sources viz. ChildLine 1098, Street presence project, Police, Railway Police, Anti Human Trafficking Unit, National Child Labour Project, public or parent themselves who approach seeking shelter help. Those children who do not have an ostensible family support are admitted to our home under the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 till suitable means of rehabilitation is found for the child, or till the child attains the age of eighteen years, as prescribed by the Child Welfare Committee, where they are produced after being rescued. Don Bosco Anbu Illam is also a Collaborative agency with the Ministry of Women and Child Development, Govt of India for running the ChildLine project since 1999, Open Shelter and CWC Reception Unit since 2010 in the city.",

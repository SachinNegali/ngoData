If one individual in a family is addicted, then it will spoil or create problem for the entire family. â€¢ To save the family and ultimately the society and nation we initiated de-addiction program and camps which includes message oriented drama, counseling through documentary,drama, film, meditation for self determination, one to one counseling from experts, lecture series and value based programs and experience sharing. Higher Education Financial Aid â€¢ To provide funds to support higher educational financial support for the poor, needy and scholar students. Self empowerment: â€¢ In this day and age , mankind has achieved an incredible degree of success which is mainly confined to the outer aspects ( exterior to our inner being ) However, many of us surprisingly find ourselves struggling with the achievement of inner stability, peace and personal harmony. â€¢ We also strive for consistent satisfaction in our thoughts and deeds. In the true sense we need self-empowerment. â€¢ We all get knocked down so that we can stand up again. Challenges are always going to punch you in the face, so through motivational talks one get courage to flight back. â€¢ We strongly believe that self empowerment will lead to the social empowerment. To achieve our objectives of self empowerment, we undertake training camps, retreat programs, conferences, workshop, lecture series, value based cultural programs. Value base training for children (Sanskarshivir): â€¢ Our Education system is developed in such a manner that the focus is to make children intellectually powerfully but no efforts is taken to make them emotionally capable. Due to this reason depression is increasing in children at very small age. â€¢ To face this challenge, we have considered moral and spiritual education as an essential part of our education system and will make efforts to adopt moral and human values for their peace, progress, growth and all round development to make them confident in near future.

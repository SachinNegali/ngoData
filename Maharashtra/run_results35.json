The society works for the upliftment of the underprivileged in the society. All the programme of the society are located in some of the most backward and needy areas of Maharashtra. One of the focus areas of the society is Child Development. Apart from various other activities, the society runs one orphanage and one School. As on date 15 children are being benefitted through the activities of the society. The children are chosen based on the level of poverty irrespective of their caste, creed or religion. All the 15 children are provided various inputs in the areas of cognitive, physical and socio emotional development. The orphanage and the School are located in Nandurbar, districts of Maharashtra.The district is home to some of the underdeveloped communities in Maharashtra. The people here belong to the tribal groups of Bhil,Kokini,Pawara, Mavchi, Varli, gamit and Ahir. Apart from them, there are people who have migrated from Nandurbar, and have been living here for several generations. and access to various services and facilities for the betterment of the community is an issue. 95% of the parents of the children work as Daily laborers in farmer estate. Their work completely depends on seasonal rains. Failure of seasonal rains would lead to starvation as people would not be able to get jobs. In addition to this, people are addicted to alcohol and drugs leading to 32% of the families being broken. Around 45% of the children in this area are malnourished.",

   "detailsOfAchievement": "A community based organization founded in 1995, Sankalp Rehabilitation Trust operates from seven permanent sites to prevent and treat HIV and other opportunistic infections affecting injecting drug users in Mumbai. Committed to a philosophy of harm reduction, a team of outreach workers and peer educators, who are former or current drug users, reach out to the street based drug using community. Needle exchange, abscess management, and safe injecting education services are initiated through this point of first contact.Medical staff and social workers provide necessary followup treatment, counseling, and distribution of Opioid Substitution Therapy at the lifeline of Sankalp, our day centres Mumbai Central, Kurla, Kalyan, and Bhiwandi. Sankalp also runs a programme for injecting drug users in prisons, where it promotes awareness, encourages adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and offers counselling and medical support. There is a 24 hour critical care centre for drug users who are seriously ill and in need of consistent medical and psychological treatment. Sankalp promotes various skills training and income generation projects. The latest venture, Project Hunar, provides recovering drug users with a residential computer training programme where they receive help in developing related professional skills and participation in a variety of educational and empowerment sessions. In addition, Sankalp has facilitated the training of several rehabilitated clients in various craft making skills, which enables them to bring in modest livelihoods. Sankalp is committed to seeking out those in need, supporting those in recovery, and strengthening its clients, so that they too can contribute positively in society.",

Credibility, based on transparency, is the main strength of SSM which has always been striving to practice the best norms in human relations and financial management. SSM is progressing confidently to meet the emerging challenges in every field. Started in village Sagroli, now SSM has scaled its work of rural development to adjoining districts with supportive interventions. Our Vision is Educated, cultured, Vigilant and prosperous Rural Communities. Our Mission is to attain Sustainable Rural development with need based, transparent and innovative approach through Value education, health, environment, non-conventional energy, animal welfare, agriculture, women & child welfare, capacity building and livelihood. SSM is involved in Educating and Empowering deprived rural communities and has changed the lives of over 30000 families. SSM has setup one of the largest residential rural schools in India accommodating 4000 boys and girls. Introduction of small, need based projects enhanced quality and pace of the school education in the past few years. Established Anand Balgram, a home for Deprived Children accommodating 108 children looked after by 12 Mothers and a Counsellor. We not only care, but help them stand on their own through higher or vocational education. Sagroli Sunrise, the well designed sports project has been shaping-up Rural Athletes since 2006. Utkarsh Vocational Training Centre established in 2009 with four basic courses; now has expanded its wings with more need based courses like Food Processing, empowering 300 youth per year. Established in 2012, the Krishi Vigyan Kendra KVK, merged with the farming communities, has introduced many developmental activities in Agriculture sector in the vicinity.

Because of intensive Equine Welfare activities carried out by SSM, the masters of Equine family Animals are taking good care of their animals, donkeys in particular. The Natural Resource Management based activities are proving a great help in eco-restoration and Livelihood Generation. Through the past 20 years the program has brought a change in the life of around 25000 families from 40 villages. SSM has coordinated with various organisations and constructed 500 Low Cost Houses for the shelter-less. The Women Self Help Groups established by SSM are now working confidently as a Federation at Sagroli. With the internal synergy and Unified Vision, we are advancing towards the Goals very firmly.

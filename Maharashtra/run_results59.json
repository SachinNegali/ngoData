To promote Socio -Economic Rehabilitation of the disabled. 2. To provide Vocational Training Facilities to the disabled. 3. To create Public awareness of and to promote public involvement in the Rehabilitation of the disabled. 4. To provide parental counseling and vocational guidance. 5. To do referral service. 6. To promote placement of the disabled. The following programmes are being undertaken by the Rehabilitation Centre to fulfil the above objectives. Programmes a. Vocational Training b. Placement Service. c. Referral Service. d. Parental Counselling. e. Conduct of Seminars, Workshops, Medical Camps, Study tours and Excursion. Full attention is given to nurture the residual abilities and hidden potentials of the disabled people. They are valued in terms of their abilities rather than their disability. Ofcourse, their disability, physical or otherwise and the handicap resulting from the disability, are given due attention and all possible steps, wherever necessary, are being taken to minimise the handicap. But we never allow their inferiority complex, resulting from disability, to dominate their residual ability. The modus operandi of the Rehabilitation Centre is structured in such a way as to achieve this goal. Catagory Served People with 1. Locomotor Disability 2. Partial Visual Impairment 3. Hearing Impairment 4. Mental Retardation 5. Cerebral Palsy 6. Multiple Disability The various activities of the Rehabilitation Centre are detailed below.

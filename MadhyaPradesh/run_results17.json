But now the scenario has been totally changed, Globalization has presented new challenges for the realization of the goal of womenâ€™s equality, the gender impact of which has not been systematically evaluated &the expenses& responsibilities has been increased at extreme level and the income of an individual is not sufficient for the survival.Its a time that both men & women work together and make the future of the INDIA because if a single women be educated & skill then she will not only become a earning participant in a family but she also plays a vital role in making her child career by her skills & experience .Women empowerment has a strengthened for prevention of women violence , including sexual harassment at work place and customs like dowry; for the rehabilitation of the victims of violence and for taking effective action against the perpetrators of such violence a women must have to be skilled &self dependent",

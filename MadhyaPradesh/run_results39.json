        "detailsOfAchievement": "The Little Ballet Troupe was founded in January, 1952 under the guidance of Shanti Bardhan in Mumbai. The formation as well as the name owed not a little to the freshness of vision and the bold spirit of experimentation which had characterized Shanti Bardhanâ€™s work even in the earlier organizations to which he had belonged. It was shared in good measure by his colleagues. They realized truly that ballet, if it was to take its proper place in the life of the people, would have to draw inspiration predominantly from folk traditions instead of being cast, as heretofore, around on individual star performer trained in one or other of Indiaâ€™s several classical traditions instead of being cast, as heretofore, around an individual star performer trained in one or other of Indiaâ€™s several classical traditions. The adjective â€˜Littleâ€™ in the title of the troupe referred neither to littleness of conception nor of artistic aim, but rather to a new and, in the prevailing atmosphere, a radical spirit of approach to ballet, which was visualized as a symbol of the highest degree of co-ordination and integration for a collective artistic purpose. Also it recognized that the Indian tradition of folk drama and the contemporary state of theatre in India, both demanded that mere extravagance of showmanship should be replaced by the economy characteristic of all true expression of creative genius. The band of founders was soon joined by other talented artists who were attracted by its seriousness of purpose and devotion to the ballet. The troupe began to function as a centre of training in the theatre arts especially dance, music and dÃ©cor, in addition to its work as a performing professional company maintaining high standards of performance. In 1964, the Little Ballet Troupe shifted from Mumbai to Gwalior to continue as a professional company and to establish a training institution. Simultaneously, it reconstituted itself as an Institute of Theatre Arts, named Ranga-Sri Little Ballet Troupe, with provision for training as well as a regular performing company. The present repertoire of the troupe comprises 37 full length ballets, Manipur, Mayurbhanj & Seraikela Chhau dances under variety of short dance numbers which can be presented independently or in conjunction with any of the ballets. In 1984, Ranga-Sri Little Ballet Troupe shifted to Bhopal. The Madhya Pradesh Government has allotted 2 acres of land in Bhopal to construct its building. Ranga-Sri performed Bhoomi Poojan on 13th March, 1995.

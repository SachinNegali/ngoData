Community Based Monitoring and Planning was introduced as important component in order to ensure that the services reach those for whom they are meant. It was an outcome of consistent effort taken by Jan Swasthya Abhiyan. Community Based Monitoring is also seen as an important aspect of promoting accountability & community led action in the field of health. The monitoring process also includes outreach services, public health facilities and the referral system. It is assumed that, the most important input on what, where and how health services are needed and should be provided or improved can be given most efficiently by the users/ beneficiaries of the services themselves. Community based monitoring places people at the centre of the process. Community Based organizations peoples movements non government organizations and Panchayat representatives monitor demand need coverage access quality effectiveness, behavior and presence of health care personnel at service points, possible denial of care and negligence as well as directly give feedback about the functioning of public health services, including giving inputs for improvement. This has enabled peoples participation in monitoring health resources and direct dialogue with health officials. The platform ensures accountable as well as transparent practices. The Neha Gramin Mahila Vikas Smiti has taken the responsibility to implement this Project as a Block NGO at Kauakol Block in Nawada District. As per objective of the program organization have been formed 33 numbers of village level planning and monitoring committee in 5 panchayat and also one Block level Planning and Monitoring Committee. During the accomplishment the organization has, organized community based Jan Samvad at Kauakol Block.",

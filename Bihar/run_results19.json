   "detailsOfAchievement": "KAUSHALYA Foundation has started its activities in October 2007 and is registered as Public Charitable Trust under Indian Registration Act at Patna. KAUSHALYA foundation focuses on mobilizing and organizing informal and fragmented vegetable sector (resource poor vegetable growers, vegetable vendors, and farm laborers) of Bihar. The goal of the foundation is to create opportunities of gainful and dignified self-employment for the families dependent on agriculture sector, especially disadvantaged sections (Farmers, farm labourers, agriculture produce vendors and many others), ensuring sustainable livelihood, enriched environment, improved quality of life and good human values. We have been working towards professionalizing vegetable street vendors and marginal growers, and empowering them to face the future challenges in the new global economy, and thus creating wealth and prosperity from farm gate to food plate through undertaking the holistic view of vegetable supply chain under our project Samriddhii. Attractive partnerships have been formed between the farmers and the vendors with a focus on shared interests and mutual growth. To maintain product integrity from source to the customer, the organisation has established a totally integrated supply chain and services bundle which connects and maintains the flow of goods from the source (growers) to customer (road-side vendors, organized retail, food service and hospitality industry). Key benefits of the model include waste reduction (quantity and time), shelf-life extension and cost reduction of agri-produce from hinterlands and upcountry sources to the markets. Accomplishments of KAUSHALYA foundation till date are: â€¢ Mobilized and registered 540 vegetable vendors (Most of them are women) in Patna. â€¢ Established the vegetable supply chain network. The foundation procures directly from the farmers and sells it through the registered vendors in the city. The foundation has 3 collection centres in Bihar which is operated under bare minimum infrastructure. â€¢ Mobilized and organized approximately 675 farmers in two districts Patna and Nalanda. â€¢ The daily throughput of vegetables through the newly established network is about 8-10 ton. â€¢ Developed an improved branded Pushcart â€“ â€œSamriddhii fresh cartâ€. The new improved pushcart will enable the vendors to compete with the best in the market (organized retailers). It has opened a new source of revenue for them in form of advertisements and promotions through the pushcart. The new modified pushcart has the space of approximately 40 sq. ft. (20 sq. ft. is with back light) where advertisements of any company can be put. It will fetch very lucrative price from the advertisers. â€¢ The organisation has successfully executed an innovative marketing and promotional schemes to increase the sale of vegetables.",

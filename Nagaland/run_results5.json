   "detailsOfAchievement": "The Youth Mission has been serving the people of Nagaland through its various activities since 1989. It first started Day-Care Counseling Programme and was subsequently upgraded to De-addiction cum Rehabilitation Centre in 2000. For over the past 2 decades, the Youth Mission has been combating drug abuse, alcoholism and spread of HIV/AIDS. The staffs being professionally well trained who have undergone various trainings both nationally and internationally provided by various organizations, have been working with dedication and commitment for drug addicts/alcoholics and HIV/AIDS free society and re-building them to become useful and healthy citizens of our country. We undertake follow up programmes by visiting the homes of our ex-clients, sending several letters and as part of our rehabilitation programme, we give guidance and rehabilitation to a number of recovered addicts and HIV+ people by providing linkage for integration into the community. Some of them are rehabilitated with vocational programme, work place and with educational settings. Besides the activities in the Rehabilitation Centre, the Youth Mission mainly focuses on the targeted groups such as Commercial Sex Workers (CSW), Addicts, Ex-addicts, Recovered addicts and students who have discontinued their studies. Counselling, treatment, guidance and awareness on preventive measures of the spread of HIV/AIDS are given to these targeted groups. We also encourage and refer them to visit Voluntary Counseling Treatment Centers (VCTC) for blood test to check their status. Awareness campaigns, seminars and workshops concerning the menace of drug abuse& alcoholism and HIV/AIDS, are conducted at various platforms such as schools, colleges, churches, hospitals, etc. As a part of our initiative, we visit Hospitals and Jails on a weekly basis and carry out Home visits: counselling addicts and their families to spread awareness, as well as giving counselling on co-dependency. The Youth Mission distributes booklets, pamphlets/leaflets to various sections of the society as part of our awareness campaign. The motto of the Youth Mission â€œRescue the Perishingâ€ as the name suggests has been rescuing many perishing people by bringing them back to the right track through its programme and activities. The general public have been made aware of the severe consequences of drug addiction/alcoholism and unprotected sex related cases such as HIV/AIDS and STDs. Many addicts and people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) have been helped in various ways through our counselling and rehabilitation programme who have now become healthy citizens. Youth Mission at the request of the State Government also started an observation Home for Juveniles in 2010 which was later converted into a Shelter Home in 2012. The Project is implemented in collaboration with the State Child Protection Society, other Organisations: Child Line, Police, etc and voluntary individuals. Providing protection, counselling, rehabilitation & reintegration of child into society, providing informal education and sponsoring the eligible for formal education, giving vocational trainings, spreading awareness on Child protection and other Child related issues, and providing immediate shelter to lost or abused children, are some of the goals fulfilled by the NGO in its endeavour to protect vulnerable children and secure for them better future for them..",

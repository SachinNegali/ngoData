   "detailsOfAchievement": "The Action for Women Development and Empowerment (AWDE), is a non-Governmental, non-profit organization formed with a vision of creating an environment where every women irrespective of her class, caste or religion leads quality life in dignity and self respect having control over her own life. In line with the vision of the organization, AWDE strive work for the development and empowerment of women through needbased interventions which consider the totality of the economic and social factors that shape a womenâ€™s environment particularly which effects womenâ€™s ability to control and improve their lives and development. Since inception, AWDE undertakes integrated multi sectoral development programmes and multiple activities to further womenâ€™s interest all over and to develop and empower women in all areas. The thrust area of the organization is creation of appropriate institutions at grassroot level with a believe that through development of skill, leadership and collective action, as well as increasing income and financial resources, an empowering environment will be created to improve womenâ€™s self-esteem, self-confidence and ability to change lives. The organization of rural poor women into a self help affinity group will greatly contribute to raise the socio-economic status of women reaching beyond to impact families and the community in general. Some of the main activities of AWDE are: â€¢ Formation and capacity building of Self Help Affinity Groups at village level; â€¢ Skill building for Women with object of equipping them with skills for alternative livelihood source; â€¢ Strengthening rural artisans and entrepreneurs through design support and rural marketing; â€¢ Reproductive Women & Child Health; â€¢ Day care service for children of working women; â€¢ Rural Livelihood Promotion activities; â€¢ Adult Education â€¢ Support services for the elderly citizens The organization has learned over the years the felt need to improve the socio- economic condition of the rural communities, particularly, women to enhance or enable them to lead a more productive meaningful life. The organization took upon itself the tasks to address this need through the approach of institutional building by promotion of Self Help Affinity Groups at village level. This intervention aims to build employable capacities in the group members by enhancing their skills and by helping them to realize their potentials as individuals and as groups in contributing to make their families and communities stronger- economically and socially which will create a sense of security amongst women and make them less vulnerable. The inputs of the organization includes facilitating of group formation, strengthening the existing ones, Capacity building on group management skills, technical skill building on income oriented trades, provision of small loan to the groups for income generation activities etc. Other support services include building linkages with other departments on schemes for piggery and poultry farms, weaving, and cultivation of vegetables for commercial purpose with the object of leveraging their income. Generally speaking, the rural poor women and girls have very little or no source of income. Most of their time is invested in cultivation works and household chores which have no monetary return. Thus, they literally have no other skill (apart from cultivation) whereby they could practice to generate their own income. The poor can be free from poverty only when they can develop themselves as human beings. We need to build their capacity to equip them with necessary skills and qualities to better their lives. Therefore training remains an important component in the whole developmental process. Thus, to facilitate a self employment process, the organization provides short term vocational training to cater to the training need of the rural women and girls and the unemployed in general.",

The Chakhesang Women Welfare Society has had the privilege of partnering with a number of Govt. & Non-Governmental agencies during the last 40 years and has been tirelessly working for the upliftment of women in particular and society in general. By the year 2020, the society wishes to see poverty being eliminated from amongst our people specially those in the villages. 1. Vocational Training: In the last 40 years the organization has imparted vocational trainings to more than 3000 women and youth on different skills such as weaving, tailoring, typing, Knitting and food processing. 2. Self Help Groups (SHGs): More than 300 Self Help Groups (SHGs) are initiated and formed under the organization. They are involved in agricultural works, piggery & poultry farming, weaving etc. In order to strengthen the SHGs the society conducts trainings in collaboration with AIACA and NABARD. 3. Joint Liability Group (JLG): Acknowledging the skills and techniques of the farmers & artisans and also to improve the living standards and enhance the financial status of the people 60 Joint Liability Groups are formed. The main emphasis is to link them up for micro credit facilities through which their existing activities can be expanded. 4. Museum: The organization with the view to preserve the traditions and culture of our forefathers established a mini Naga Museum. It is an attraction to the tourists & researchers. 5. Chakhesang Naga Cuisine Booklet: The organization has produced a booklet on Chakhesang Naga Cuisine in 2007 which was well accepted by the Nagas. 6. Attires Book: A book on Chakhesang attires and ornaments called Chakhesang Naga Attires & Ornaments was produced and released by the organization. Its 1st edition was in 1995 and the 2nd in 2016. The 1st edition initiated by our elders is further enriched and enhanced in the 2nd edition. 7. Tribal Development Fund: Tribal Development Fund which is funded by the NABARD by reaching out to 500 families in 8 villages for Horticulture and piggery. This project aims at long term and big scale production which aims at improving the annual income of the poor farmers through practicing intercropping cultivation. The produce of the farmers have already found a market outside the locality. 8. â€œFrom subsistence to prosperity through community led and managed livelihoods program in Phek Districtâ€ supported by Tata Trust: The project started in April 2015 in partnership with North East Initiative Development Agency supported by Tata Trusts. The project will cover 5000 households under agriculture and 4000 households of piggery & allied activities promotion. 9.

Our main focus has been on rural development, women empowerment, health, Prevention of Substance Abuse and HIV/AIDS, education of poor children, welfare of the Differently abled. In all these areas we have achieved a lot in terms of carrying out meaningful programs and projects reaching out to mainly the last, the lost and the least. One of our main achievements are in the areas of community health through a series of outreach programs and trainging of village health workers and managing rural dispensaries in different parts of Nagaland. Another main achievements are in the field of Substance abuse and HIV/AIDS. A lot of awareness has been created among a cross section of people in the villages, churches and schools. We have also helped a number of people to come out of Substance abuse and get quality treatment, care and support of HIV/AIDS clients through our Community care Centre and Positive living Centre. Another major achievement is in the sector of Women empowerment through Animation and promotion of Peoples organizations like SHGs in different parts of Nagaland. Another achievement is our ability to work in collaboration with various NGOs and Goverment departments.",

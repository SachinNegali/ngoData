   "detailsOfAchievement": "Special achievements A brief note on special achievements of Jan Shikshan Sansthan Kupwara highlighting the qualitative aspects including impact of the programmes on the beneficiaries, innovative programmes undertaken and special activities conducted etc. Removal of illiteracy and importing the knowledge of 3Râ€™s to all the illiterate people in the age group of 15-35 in our country is the main target of National Literacy Mission. Realizing this need and growing urbanization in the coming decades, the ministry of education had started a scheme of Shramik Vidya Peeths (SVPâ€™s), a program of adult education for workers in urban and industrial areas. The scheme showed tremendous achievement in covering illiterates/ neo literates under the banner of skill and knowledge development. To facilitate playing a better role the scheme of Shramik Vidya Peeths was renamed as Jan Shikshan Sansthan (JSS), institute of peopleâ€™s education with enhanced financial support. Jan Shikshan Sansthan (JSS), Kupwara is conceived as an institute for conducting skill up-gradation in the areas of programs of non-formal adult and continuing education. It would also provide academic and technical resource support to Zila Saksharta Samittee (ZSS) in both urban and rural areas. JSS Kupwara has trained at least 15000 beneficiaries from the entire district since 2007 @ 2000 beneficiaries every year. Moreover with the help of JSS, Kupwara 45 beneficiaries got employment, 150 under self employment, 250 under wage employment, 25 beneficiaries got loan from bank for establishment of their own units after completion of JSSâ€™s training. The main objectives of Jan Shikshan Sansthan Kupwara are to improve the occupational skills and technical knowledge of the neo-literates. To provide academic and technical support to Zila Saksharta Samittee (ZSS) in taking of vocational and skill development programmes for neo-literates. To serve as nodal continuing education centers and training orientation centers for key resource persons. The last but not the least objective of the Jan Shikshan Sansthan is to promote national goals, womenâ€™s equality, protection and conservation of environment. In J&K at Kupwara district JSS was launched in November 2007, sanctioned by Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) Govt. of India keeping in view the financial and the educational backwardness of the district. At present the main centre of Jan Shikshan Sansthan (JSS) located at Branwari opposite DSPâ€™s office exchange road Kupwara is running courses related to different trades such as , Automobile Technician, Electrical Technician, Dress Making., Hand/Machine Embroider, Fashion Designing, Basic Food Preservation, Furniture Making, Plumbing & Sanitary, Photography & Videography, Banner & Sign Board Designing, Hand/Machine Knitting etc. In relation to which, 11 extension centers in Kupwara block, 37 extension centers in Karnah block and 10 extension centers at Handwara block provide skill development and knowledge of 3Râ€™s.",

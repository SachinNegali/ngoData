It has made major contributions in projecting and popularising Odissi dance and music, as well as imparting intensive training to upcoming artistes both in India and abroad. Presently it has 200 regular students of different batches. Here training is imparted by eminent and experience teachers from the field of Odissi dance . It has a strong repertory group comprising 30 dancers(15 males & 15 females) of national and international repute. But it seems too difficult for a voluntary organisation having limited resources to impart advanced training to the talented students. Our sole aim behind this project is to prepare a fresh batch of students imparting them technical and scientific training by organising seminars, workshops and lec-dems.",

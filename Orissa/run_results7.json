        "detailsOfAchievement": "(i) Access to Justice: There is a Legal Service Centre in CLAP, which ensures access to justice. Legal Service Centre spearheads various Legal Support Services, which are aimed at enabling Legal Aid Eligible persons/communities to establish their rights and entitlements. The nature of legal support services offered by Legal Service Centre includes: Legal Aid in Court Proceedings, Legal Advice, Referral Services, Representation, and Public Interest Litigations. The CLAP also operates a Family Dispute Resolution Centre for restoring the childrenâ€™s right to parental care during the dispute between the couples. This initiative of CLAP is made through Law-Based Conciliation, which offers expert mediation facilities for amicable settlement of disputes between the disputant parties considering the best interest of their children. This kind of settlement of dispute outside the court system enhances the possibility of reunionisation of the couples at the pre-litigation stage. The law-based conciliation is aimed at ensuring the childrenâ€™s right to parental care in conformity with Article 9, 10, 11, 18, 20 of UNCRC, securing the safe childhood as well as providing the children a conducive family environment to grow.(ii) Realizing Rights: CLAP focuses on two programmes, which ensure the realization of rights of people living in two geographical distinctions i.e. rural area and urban area. These two programmes are called Urban Legal Intervention Programme (ULIP) based in urban set up and Rural Legal Intervention Programme (RULIP) based in rural set up. The projects of CLAP meant for urban areas find expression through ULIP. During the year 2007-08, CLAP implemented a project called Civil Registration for Children in Cuttack City for promotion of civil registration right of children living in slum areas in order to advance the Urban Legal Intervention Programme. Rural Legal Intervention Programme (RULIP) focuses on promotion of good governance in a rural setting. It takes law to the rural household and communities for protection of rural entitlement. The projects of CLAP meant for rural areas find expression through ULIP. During the year 2007-08, a project called Right Path to Education (RPE), which is in operation in Badamba block of Cuttack district, found expression through RULIP. The project focuses on access to pre-primary education, community empowerment and birth registration. (iii) Strengthening Civil Society: CLAP has a Legal Support Network with a membership base of 1000 Registered NGOs spreading all over the State of Orissa, which is considered as the largest NGO network in Orissa in terms of membership affiliation. CLAP facilitates the work of these members through providing legal support services in various forms like capacity building of its Network Members, providing legal resource materials in demystified language and by extending legal services in the form of aid and advice when critical legal issues comes up.(iv) Legal Education: CLAP advances legal education for promotion of legal literacy for creating a viable democracy and realization of human rights. The objective of Legal Education is to create awareness about public interest laws, to spread the knowledge about the laws for public education on human rights and democracy, to disseminate the information relating to law having bearing on human rights and to promote Legal Literacy. The above-mentioned objectives are conditions precedent to the Rule of Law society.(v) Legal Research and Evidence Based Advocacy: Legal Research is one of the core programmes of CLAP. The philosophy behind legal research revolves around the notion that â€˜Law is a tool for social reform and issue of governance shall rest on the principles of lawâ€™. Thus legal research of CLAP aims at finding deficiencies in the existing laws as well as identifying grey areas in practice of good laws. Such endeavour provides vital inputs to pursue an evidence-based advocacy for bringing legal reform as well as practices. (vi) Campaigns and Movements: CLAP undertakes thematic campaigns, which are very much relevant in the contemporary context and based on social needs. In the year 2007, CLAP launched a specialized campaign in the nomenclature of National Campaign for ECCE Right (NCER) for creating a civil society debate and demand on giving statutory back up to Article 45 of Constitution of India. There is another such endeavour of CLAP called CRC â€“ 7 Campaign that works for universal civil registration of children. Besides these two campaigns, CLAP spearheads a citizenâ€™s movement called Liberated Childhood Movement (LCM) for liberation of children from all forms of slavery and restraint. Another movement based in a rural pocket in Badamba Block called Right Path to Education (RPE) is being undertaken by CLAP for promotion of access to education system and elimination of child labour practices.",

        "detailsOfAchievement": "A consumer organisation with a difference. Instead of rendering advisory services alone, the Council since its inception, in 1985, has been taking up issues affecting them through the consumer courts and other means and feels proud to have provided relief to crores of people. These include: *Remedial action against short-filling of LPG in cooking gas refills; 184 Bottling Plants, of the 3 Oil Marketing Companies (IOCL, BPCL & HPCL), which were the root cause of the short-filling of LPG in the cooking gas refills have been automated, at a cost of about Rs. 300 crores, by the Ministry of Petroleum and Chemicals. The quantified loss of nearly Rs. 750 crores per year to the consumers, across the country has been taken care by this upgradation. This was due to the Original Petition of the Council, initiated in 2001, before the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC); *Won an important case against the Rourkela Development Authority and secured financial relief for a group of individuals, against violation of Plan and Specifications in the construction of the houses and delay in handing over the possession; *Obtained a separate District Forum for Rourkela, though it is not the district headquarters, which otherwise necessitated the entire Rourkela population to approach the Forum, situated at Sundergarh, a place 100 kms. away; *Rerouting of Dhanbad-Alleppey Express Train through Chennai Central; *Campaigned against non-transferring of Excise Duty concessions (to the consumers) extended by the Union government to the industry; *Better upkeep of the Railway coaches of Utkal Kalinga Express and other trains; *Reintroduction of Ac Chair Car in Ispat Express and elimination of unfair trade practice by the SE Railway; *Refunding of Booking Advance by M/s LML and APSL; and *many more. To educate the consumers and create an awareness, the Council has been publishing its monthly, ADVANTAGE CONSUMER, for the last 28 years. Its website www.advantageconsumer.com, with a collection of important consumer dispute judgements of the National Commission and the Apex Court, has been serving the consumers, for the past 16 years, as a store house of information as to how the Consumer Protection Act can help the common man to redress his grievances. The Chief Mentor, has been answering and guiding the consumers across the country, FREE OF COST, ever since the website of the Council became operational in March 2000. The Council has redressed over 1500 individual complaints, through its own ADR mechanism. The innovative approach of the Council, whether it be putting up huge sign-boards (way back in 1989), to educate the consumers, or filing ever class action complaint in the State Commission, Orissa, (LML and APSL cases, 1989), have remained trail blazers for others to follow. All these had been done without any institutional funding, either from within the country or outside it.",

To save the children and their unfortunate and helpless mothers John Augustus Organisation extends the hand and heart to serve the Prison World taking care of the education of children of poor convicts of entire State Jails since 2003. John Augustus Prison and Social Welfare Services for first time in Odisha thought for the education of helpless and unfortunate children of poor convicts of State Jails. The views of the Organisation are very simple but noble. We tried our best to bring back the peace and happiness of the family members of convicts to which they missed. The people who committed the crime, their loving world turned to four walls of Jail. But their innocent children and their family members became the real victim of series of sorrows and sufferings. We support the innocent children of the Convicts who suffer more having no offence of theirs. We want to make them at least Matriculate and to make them good citizen of the society. To add to this, from the year 2010, we have supported the children of long term U.T. prisoners of different jails of the State providing them Text Books and Study Materials as in case of convicts. During the year 2016-17, 147 children of prisoners became Matriculate. John Augustus Organisation at first took the charge of education of children of poor convicts during the year 2003. We are now covering the entire State Jails and the year-wise children we supported with Text Books, Study Materials and Matriculation Exam. Fee is as follows 2003 - 126 , 2004 - 205, 2005 - 330, 2006 - 363, 2007 - 440, 2008 - 608, 2009 - 1040 , 2010 - 1549, 2011 - 1688, 2012 - 1815, 2013 - 1830, 2014 - 1905, 2015 - 1965 2016 - 1846 By this an unfortunate mother of a helpless child is definitely happy that her child is being cared by someone, even in the absence of the father whose world is limited to four walls only. On the other hand the prisoners are equally happy that their children are reading in the absence of theirs. This is a service which offers mental satisfaction and pleasure at a time to the neglected child, helpless mother and unfortunate father. Our service is dedicated to the Unreached, Unfortunate and Distressed group of our Society.",

        "detailsOfAchievement": "Background â€œKARTABYAâ€ is a group of new generations who spontaneously donate their leisure and labour for the cause of those who spend their every moment of live through appetite, insanitation, illiteracy, ignorance and poverty. The organization has got its establishment to materialize the dedicated and volunteer attitude of development professionals for the cause of society. Areas of Action â–º Socio â€“ economic upliftment of street and slum children. â–º Capacity building and empowering the tribal and rural poor. â–º Women empowerment â–º Rural healthy and sanitation â–º Revival of traditional health system. â–º Environment protection. â–º Self-employment training programme in tribal and rural areas. â–º Impact assessment on development interventions COMPOSITE CENTER FOR THE SLUM AND WORKING CHILDREN Community sharing â€¢ Entire project activity shared among the slum people so that they became aware on the objectives and expected outcome of the project. â€¢ Inputs from the community and the target parents are taken for the sustainability of the project. â€¢ It was suggested in the community sharing that the targeted slum children need to be enumerated to know the overall status of the slum children. Formation of committee â€¢ A parent committee is being formed in the community. The committee sits once in a month to discuss the underlying problems and possible solutions of checking the slum children from child labour. â€¢ Discussions are also made on the issues of street children and what are the step scan be undertaken to check the vulnerability of the street children. It was also discussed in the meeting that part of the activity of the composite center of the slum children should be made for the street children. Education and Main streaming â€¢ A community school is running in the slum where 100 children are getting education. Each child is being facilitated for continuation of education. Efforts are being undertaken to mainstream the slum children into the formal education system. Vocational training programme â€¢ The vocational need and capacity is identified among the targeted children. Those are eligible to get the vocational training; they are given training on tailoring and appliquÃ©. â€¢ Some of the children are also given training on plumbing and carpentry. â€¢ Counseling are provided to the parents of the targeted children through a psychologist/counselor of the organization regarding exploitation of children and not to engage them in the wage related activities. Health check up â€¢ Regular health checks up camps are being organized for the slum and street children in the target area. Primary treatments are provided to the children during the camp. CAPACITY BUILDING PROGRAMME FOR THE PRIS It is evident that Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) are the key stakeholders in the development process of the state as well as the country. They are placed in an important place which relates the community needs with the government development programmes. Due to lack of capacity of the PRI members and interest on the part of Government officials, PRI functionaries are not able to exercise their power to a great extent. This was the finding from the workshop on PRI, which was conducted in project locations of Keonhar and Nuapara District. The participants of the workshop were the PRI functionaries, community leader and Govt. officials who provided valuable opinions on effective functioning of Panchayats in the state. TRAINING AND CAPACITY BUILDING OF WOMEN In our recent modern society women find little or no space to assert their rights. Their situation is also more vulnerable in the context of globalization. They always fall back in realizing the ultimate outcome of every socio-economic development initiatives undertaken by different agencies. Apart from that there are number of taboos exists in the society which prevents them participate in every sphere of work and also they are not prioritized in compared to male counterparts. Looking into this background the organization has organized a mass community awareness programme on empowerment. The resource persons of the programme conveyed the message on the available entitlements for the women groups and how they can access those benefits without any sort of hurdles. Apart from this they were also oriented on the official procedure on getting those benefits. The outcome of the activity helped the women group to access the schemes implemented by different agencies. Already formed 52 Self-help groups were invited into different phases. They got trained on the book keeping mechanism and they also got the knowledge on the vocational training. There were also subjects covering the marking of the available local products. BRIDGE COURSE PROGRAMME FOR OUT-OF-SCHOOL CHILDREN With an objective to provide education to the out-of-school children, the organization has been assigned by the Govt of orissa to conduct bridge course programme in the slum areas of Bhubaneswar city. In this process, the targeted children are identified with the help of existing education committees of the slum. Thus, the organization has tried to bring the street children into limelight by providing them education, which will enhance their mental ability. At the same time awareness was created among the parents to create demand for education so that they can access basic rights of life. SOCIO-ECONOMIC SURVEY OF THE DISPLACED PERSONS The organization has undertaken a survey of the displaced persons in the nearby areas of the Dhamara port. The objective was to identify the project affected persons to get the compensation amount. The survey questions were prepared by the Dhamara Port Authority, which contained the socio-economic background of the families, their occupational status, land and other details of the target households. Thus based on this survey the authority of the Dhamara port is planning to provide identity cards for the project affected persons so that in future there will be no confusion in receiving compensation amount. CAMPAIGN ON ENVIRONMENT AWARENESS It was felt that environment protection would make the society towards sustainable development. Looking into this the organization has organized a environment awareness campaign with the school students of Bhubaneswar. Students participated in the rally organized by the organization. Leaflets were distributed to create a mass awareness among the general people. There was also a general meeting with the slum community where local resource persons delivered their views on the need for environment protection and how this will save our future generation in the context of growing industrialization. There were also representation of community level leaders, key persons such as teachers and other community members in the general meeting",

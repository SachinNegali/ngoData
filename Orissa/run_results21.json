        "detailsOfAchievement": "The PEOPLEâ€™S FORUM being founded on 2nd October, 1988 has stressed on sustainable development and equitable justice as its priority agenda. This twenty one years old organisation is an initiation of a dream, seen by few benevolent youth who craved for a better society by helping the people to help themselves. They started this organisation as a podium for activists who were supposed to fight for the under privileged and weaker sections. The platform accommodated each and every person who needs security and justice at their level. Keeping in mind the principles of Pujya Bapuji, the organisation founded its pillar on the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, 2nd October 1988. Gradually the organisation attained recognition under Society Registration ACT XXI of 1860 in 1990, 12 (A) of income tax registration in 1995, FCRA Registration ACT OF 1976 IN 1995 and Ind 80(G) registration under income tax in 2004. Now with all pride itâ€™s an opportunity for Peopleâ€™s Forum that the organization of 21 years is promoting different institutions and trying for self-sufficiency. It has declared itself as a single mental health rehabilitation center in entire eastern zone. Till today we have recued more than 500 hundred destitute abandoned and neglected mentally ill mentally challenged women from various corner of the state in and around. The rehabilitation center has 167 inmates with 15 children and 152 inmates were reunited with their respective families. Including this we are also involved in various activities like Microfinance, Entrepreneurship development progmmes, rural Marketing, Agriculture and pisciculture farms, Training institution, Business Development support services, etc though initiated earlier but truly be strengthened during this period. However in spite of our shift over approaches, it is vital to mention that the organization has never left out any of its prior responsibilities. Rather it is still attached to the activities done years before keeping its original vision and mission intact. Out of the many told activities PEOPLEâ€™S FORUM has initiated few programs & activities highlighting few issues being operated through different cells created for specific purposes, with its minimum resources & tiny work force which are presented here under. Core area : ï‚§ Mental Health & Community Health ( programme on rescue , rehabilitation and re integration ) ï‚§ Women development ï‚§ Health & nutrition ï‚§ Trafficking Women & girls( programme on rescue , rehabilitation and re integration ) ï‚§ Micro Finance ï‚§ Natural resource management ï‚§ Human rights ï‚§ Economic viability of the deprived mass ï‚§ Care for the disabled with special emphasis to the aged ï‚§ Environment and sanitation ï‚§ Emergency relief and rehabilitation ï‚§ Disaster preparedness Operational Strategy ï‚§ Vocational training, occupational training ï‚§ Rescue, treatment, rehabilitation, reintegration with the community and family ï‚§ Workshops, training, seminar, health camps, rally, exhibition etc.( at central and field level) ï‚§ Networking ï‚§ Observation of important days",
